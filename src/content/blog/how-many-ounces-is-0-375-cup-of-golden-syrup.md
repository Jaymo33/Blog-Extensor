<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much golden syrup can make dishes overly sticky, while too little might leave them bland.

<h3>How to measure golden syrup accurately</h3>  
<p>Golden syrup is sticky and can be tricky to measure. To get exactly 0.375 cup (4.5 oz), lightly grease your measuring cup with oil to help the syrup slide out easily. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale for the most precise measurement. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes where small adjustments can affect cooking times.

<h2>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s often used in glazes for meats, such as air-fried gammon or chicken wings.

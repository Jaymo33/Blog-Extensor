<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results. Too much ketchup in a marinade, for example, might make your dish overly soggy.

<h3>How to measure 50g of tomato ketchup without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use tablespoons to measure 50g of tomato ketchup. Roughly three level tablespoons equal 50g or 1.76 ounces. For sticky ingredients like ketchup, lightly grease the spoon for easier release. This method is handy for quick adjustments in recipes. Always level off the spoon for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 50g of tomato ketchup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato ketchup is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. A 50g portion (1.76 oz) works perfectly for glazing meatballs, coating chicken wings, or adding tang to homemade burgers.

<h2>Tips for storing and using tomato ketchup in air fryer cooking</h2>

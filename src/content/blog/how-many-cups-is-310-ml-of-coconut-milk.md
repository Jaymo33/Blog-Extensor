<p>310 ml of coconut milk is roughly 1.31 cups in the UK or 1.25 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, baking, or cooking where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up a curry, baking a cake, or making a creamy sauce, knowing how to measure coconut milk correctly ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of coconut milk can make or break your dish. Too little, and your recipe might turn out dry or lack flavour. Too much, and it could become soggy or overly rich. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise measurements to achieve that perfect crispiness or tenderness. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>
<p>Coconut milk is a staple in many cuisines, from Thai curries to vegan desserts. Its rich, creamy texture adds depth to dishes, but measuring it incorrectly can throw off the balance. Whether you're using tinned or fresh coconut milk, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more handy tips and recipes.</p>

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 310 ml of coconut milk translates to approximately 1.31 cups in the UK and 1.25 cups in the US. These small differences might seem negligible, but they can affect the outcome of your recipe, especially in baking or air fryer dishes where precision is key.</p>
<p>If you're following a recipe from a different country, always check which measurement system it uses. Many online recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe page</a>, specify the measurement system to avoid confusion. For example, a US recipe calling for 310 ml of coconut milk would mean 1.25 cups, whereas a UK recipe would mean 1.31 cups.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Coconut Milk Without a Scale</h3>
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug or scale, you can use a standard tablespoon or teaspoon to measure 310 ml of coconut milk. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so you'd need roughly 20 tablespoons to reach 310 ml. Alternatively, a standard UK cup holds 284 ml, so 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons would give you approximately 310 ml.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 310 ml of Coconut Milk</h2>
<p>310 ml of coconut milk is a versatile amount used in many recipes. It's perfect for making a creamy Thai green curry, a batch of dairy-free ice cream, or a rich vegan soup. In the air fryer, it can be used to marinate chicken or tofu, adding moisture and flavour. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>.</p>
<p>Another popular use is in baking, where coconut milk adds richness to cakes and muffins. It's also a great base for smoothies or overnight oats. If you're meal prepping, 310 ml of coconut milk can be portioned out for multiple dishes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a> for ideas.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Coconut Milk</h3>
<p>If you don't use all 310 ml of coconut milk, store the leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for smaller portions. Just thaw and stir well before using, as it may separate slightly. For more storage tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

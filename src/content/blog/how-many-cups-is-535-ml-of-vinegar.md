<p>535 ml of vinegar equals approximately 2.26 cups in the US measurement system and roughly 2.11 cups in the UK metric system. Whether you're preparing a tangy marinade or a zesty dressing, getting the vinegar measurement right is crucial for balanced flavours. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Vinegar Measurements</h2>  
<p>Vinegar is a staple in many kitchens, used for everything from pickling to deglazing pans. When a recipe calls for 535 ml of vinegar, knowing the cup equivalent ensures accuracy. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml. This slight difference can affect recipes, so it's important to check which system your recipe uses.</p>  

<p>For air fryer cooking, precise measurements help avoid overly acidic or bland results. If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, we specify measurements clearly to prevent mishaps. Whether you're making crispy chicken wings or a vinegar-based glaze, 535 ml of vinegar translates to just over 2 cups in most cases.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which means liquids like vinegar can reduce faster than in conventional ovens. Using the correct amount ensures your dish isn't too sharp or weak in flavour. If a recipe calls for 535 ml of vinegar, measure carefully—especially when making sauces or marinades.</p>  

<h2>Converting 535 ml of Vinegar for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking relies heavily on precise measurements, and vinegar often acts as a leavening agent when combined with baking soda. If your cake or bread recipe requires 535 ml of vinegar, you'll need about 2.26 US cups or 2.11 UK cups. Too much vinegar can overpower the dish, while too little may affect texture.</p>  

<p>For air fryer baking, such as our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, we recommend using a measuring jug for liquids. If you don't have one, a standard metric measuring cup will do—just ensure you're using the right cup size for your region. A slight miscalculation can alter the chemical reactions in baking, so double-check your conversions.</p>

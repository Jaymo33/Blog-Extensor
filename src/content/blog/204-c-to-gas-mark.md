<h2>What is 204 C to Gas Mark?</h2>
<p>204°C converts to Gas Mark 6, a common setting for roasting and baking. This temperature is ideal for dishes like roast chicken, cakes, and casseroles. Whether you're using a conventional oven or an air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend checking your appliance’s manual for slight variations. Gas Mark 6 delivers steady, even heat, making it a versatile choice for many recipes.</p>
<p>Gas Mark settings are traditionally used in British ovens, while modern air fryers often display temperatures in Celsius. Converting 204 C to Gas Mark helps bridge the gap between old and new cooking methods. For example, if a recipe calls for 204°C but your oven uses Gas Mark, you’ll now know it’s Gas Mark 6. This conversion is especially handy for air fryer users adapting oven recipes. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<h2>Why Use Gas Mark 6 (204 C) in Cooking?</h2>
<p>Gas Mark 6, or 204°C, strikes a balance between moderate and high heat, perfect for browning and crisping. It’s a go-to for roasting meats, baking bread, and even air-frying frozen foods. The steady temperature ensures food cooks evenly without burning. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> recommend this setting for juicy, golden results. Air fryers can achieve similar outcomes faster, thanks to their efficient circulation.</p>
<p>When converting 204 C to Gas Mark for baking, remember that air fryers may require slight adjustments. For instance, reduce cooking time by 20% when using an air fryer at 204°C. This prevents overcooking while maintaining that desirable crispness. Gas Mark 6 is also excellent for reheating leftovers, giving them a fresh-from-the-oven feel. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration tailored to this temperature.</p>

<h3>How to Convert 204 C to Gas Mark for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Most air fryers display temperatures in Celsius, but some older models or recipes might reference Gas Mark. To convert 204 C to Gas Mark 6, simply set your air fryer to 204°C. If your air fryer has presets, look for a "roast" or "bake" option close to this temperature. Always preheat your air fryer for 3-5 minutes at 204°C for best results. This ensures even cooking, just like a conventional oven at Gas Mark 6.</p>

<h2>Common Dishes Cooked at 204 C (Gas Mark 6)</h2>
<p>From crispy roast potatoes to fluffy Victoria sponge cakes, 204°C (Gas Mark 6) is a workhorse temperature. It’s hot enough to create a golden crust but gentle enough to cook food through evenly. Try it for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roast potatoes</a>, achieving that perfect crunch without drying them out. Air fryers excel at this temperature, delivering crispier results in less time than traditional ovens.</p>
<p>For baking, Gas Mark 6 (204°C) is ideal for scones, cookies, and even homemade bread. The heat encourages rise and browning without scorching. In an air fryer, reduce the quantity to avoid overcrowding, which can affect airflow. This ensures every item cooks uniformly, whether you’re baking or roasting. Discover more tips in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your appliance performing at its best.</p>

<h3>Tips for Cooking at 204 C to Gas Mark 6</h3>
<p>Always use an oven thermometer to verify your appliance’s accuracy, as some ovens or air fryers may run hot or cold. For air fryers, shake or flip food halfway through cooking to ensure even browning at 204°C. When adapting oven recipes, start checking for doneness a few minutes early, as air fryers cook faster. Keep your air fryer basket clean to maintain optimal airflow, crucial for consistent results at Gas Mark 6 equivalents.</p>

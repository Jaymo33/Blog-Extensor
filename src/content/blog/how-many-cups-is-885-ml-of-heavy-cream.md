<p>885 ml of heavy cream is approximately 3.74 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency and delicious results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with heavy cream, even small measurement discrepancies can affect the texture and taste of your dish. Too much cream can make sauces overly rich, while too little might leave them lacking in flavour. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results every time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Heavy cream is a staple in many recipes, from soups to desserts. Whether you're making a creamy pasta sauce or a fluffy cake, knowing that 885 ml of heavy cream equals roughly 3.74 cups simplifies the process. This is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down to suit your needs.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Heavy Cream Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup for 885 ml of heavy cream. Fill it to the appropriate line and check at eye level to avoid over or under-pouring. If you're using a standard cup measure, remember that 1 cup equals 236.59 ml, so 885 ml works out to just under 3 and 3/4 cups.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 885 ml of Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>Heavy cream is incredibly versatile, and 885 ml (or 3.74 cups) is a common quantity for many recipes.

<p>Another popular use for 885 ml of heavy cream is in baking. Cakes, scones, and pastries often call for this ingredient to add moisture and richness. If you're experimenting with new recipes, having an accurate conversion ensures your bakes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Converting 885 ml of Heavy Cream in Different Regions</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that cup measurements can vary slightly depending on where you are. In the UK, a standard cup is 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml.

<h2>Tips for Working with Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>Heavy cream can be tricky to work with if not handled properly. When measuring 885 ml, ensure your cream is cold for the most accurate results. Warm cream can expand slightly, leading to inaccuracies. For best results, store your cream in the fridge until you're ready to use it.</p>

<p>10 grams (10g) of molasses equals approximately 0.35 ounces (0.35 oz). This conversion is essential for precise measurements in air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're baking, glazing, or marinating, knowing how to convert 10g of molasses to ounces helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making air fryer cooking effortless with accurate conversions and delicious recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate molasses measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of molasses is crucial for balancing sweetness and texture in your air fryer dishes. Too much can overpower flavours, while too little might leave your recipe lacking depth. For example, a sticky glaze or a rich cake batter relies on precise measurements. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess. Whether you're making gingerbread or barbecue sauce, 10g of molasses (0.35 oz) ensures perfect results.</p>  

<p>Molasses is a common ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from desserts like sticky toffee pudding to savoury dishes like glazed meats. Knowing how to convert 10g of molasses to ounces helps you follow recipes accurately, especially when scaling up or down. If you're experimenting with new dishes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration. Accurate measurements guarantee your creations turn out just as intended, whether you're cooking for one or a crowd.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 10g of molasses without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 10g of molasses (0.35 oz) using a tablespoon. One level tablespoon of molasses weighs roughly 20g, so half a tablespoon will give you approximately 10g. For even more precision, use a teaspoon—about 2 teaspoons equal 10g. This method is handy when you're in a pinch or working with smaller quantities. Just remember, molasses is sticky, so lightly greasing your measuring spoon can help it slide off easily.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 10g of molasses in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Molasses adds depth and richness to both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes. A small amount, like 10g (0.35 oz), can transform a simple glaze or marinade. For example, mix it with soy sauce and garlic for a quick barbecue glaze on chicken wings. Or, stir it into cake batter for a moist, flavourful dessert. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> to see how molasses enhances treats like cookies and cakes.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 10g of molasses is in homemade granola or energy bars. The sticky sweetness helps bind ingredients together while adding a caramel-like flavour. You can also drizzle it over roasted vegetables, like carrots or sweet potatoes, before air frying for a touch of sweetness.

<h3>Tips for storing and handling molasses</h3>  
<p>Molasses can thicken over time, making it tricky to measure. To keep it pourable, store it in a cool, dark place and give the bottle a warm water bath if it hardens. Always wipe the rim after use to prevent sticking. For easy cleanup, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a>.

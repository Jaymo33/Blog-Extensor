<p>0.75 tbsp of treacle equals approximately 15 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking cakes or glazing meats. Treacle, a thick and sticky syrup, can be tricky to measure, so knowing the gram equivalent helps avoid messy spills and ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate treacle measurements matter</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements are key to achieving the perfect texture and flavour. Too much treacle can make desserts overly sweet or cause glazes to burn, while too little might leave dishes lacking richness. Converting 0.75 tbsp of treacle to grams (15g) ensures accuracy, whether you’re making sticky toffee pudding or a glaze for roasted vegetables. For more air fryer conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Treacle’s thick consistency means it’s easy to over-pour, leading to wasted ingredients and inconsistent results. By weighing it in grams, you’ll save time and reduce mess. Plus, many air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>treacle tart</a>, rely on exact measurements for the best outcome.</p>  

<h3>How to measure treacle without the mess</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.75 tbsp of treacle (15g) cleanly, lightly grease your spoon with oil first—this helps the treacle slide off easily. Alternatively, use a digital kitchen scale for pinpoint accuracy. If you’re scaling up a recipe, remember that 1 tbsp of treacle equals roughly 20g, so adjust accordingly.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for treacle in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Treacle adds depth to both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes. It’s a star ingredient in gingerbread cakes, sticky glazes for ham, or even marinades for roasted vegetables. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, featuring treacle-based treats optimised for air frying.</p>  

<p>Because treacle caramelises beautifully in the air fryer’s high heat, it’s perfect for creating glossy finishes on meats or adding chewiness to cookies. Just remember: 0.75 tbsp (15g) is often enough to coat a single portion without overpowering other flavours. Keep your air fryer clean after using sticky ingredients with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other treacle measurements</h3>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 1 tsp of treacle weighs about 7g, while 1 tbsp equals 20g. For larger batches, 100g of treacle is roughly 5 tbsp. These conversions ensure your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time, whether you’re baking or glazing.</p>

<p>0.75 tbsp of treacle equals approximately 15 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking cakes or glazing meats. Treacle, a thick and sticky syrup, can be tricky to measure, so knowing the gram equivalent helps avoid messy spills and ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate treacle measurements matter</h2>

Too much treacle can make desserts overly sweet or cause glazes to burn, while too little might leave dishes lacking richness.

<p>Treacle’s thick consistency means it’s easy to over-pour, leading to wasted ingredients and inconsistent results. By weighing it in grams, you’ll save time and reduce mess. Plus, many air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>treacle tart</a>, rely on exact measurements for the best outcome.</p>

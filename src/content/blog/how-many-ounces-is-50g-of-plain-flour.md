<p>50g of plain flour equals approximately 1.76 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer, especially when following recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're baking air fryer cakes or coating chicken for a crispy finish, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of plain flour can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much flour can lead to dry, dense results, while too little might leave your dishes undercooked or lacking structure. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, even a small discrepancy in flour weight can affect texture and spread.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for baking, use grams for precision. However, some older cookbooks or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces. That's why knowing how to convert 50g of plain flour to ounces (1.76 oz) is so handy. It bridges the gap between measurement systems effortlessly.</p>  

<h3>Tools for measuring 50g of plain flour</h3>  
<p>The most accurate way to measure 50g of plain flour is with digital kitchen scales. If you don't have scales, you can use measuring cups, but be aware that flour settles and compacts. Spooning flour lightly into a cup and levelling it off gives roughly 50g (about ½ cup). For consistent air fryer results, we recommend investing in scales – they're inexpensive and eliminate guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Converting other flour amounts</h2>  
<p>Once you've mastered converting 50g of plain flour to ounces (1.76 oz), you can apply the same principle to other quantities. As a rule, 1 gram equals 0.035 ounces. So 100g would be 3.53 ounces, and 25g would be 0.88 ounces.

<p>Different types of flour have slightly different weights due to density variations. For instance, wholemeal flour is denser than plain flour, so 50g takes up less volume. When substituting flour types in air fryer recipes, it's best to weigh rather than use cup measurements for accuracy.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 50g of plain flour</h3>  
<p>50g of plain flour is a common measurement in many air fryer recipes. You might use it for coating chicken before air frying, making small batches of batter for tempura vegetables, or preparing the dry ingredients for air fryer scones.

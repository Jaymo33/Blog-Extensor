<p>125g of tahini equals approximately 4.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of hummus or drizzling tahini over roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we believe accurate measurements are the key to culinary success. Let’s dive deeper into why this conversion matters and how to use it in your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 125g of Tahini to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use grams as the standard measurement. However, some kitchen scales or international recipes might list tahini in ounces. Converting 125g of tahini to ounces ensures you’re using the right amount for dishes like tahini cookies or dressings. A slight miscalculation could alter the texture or flavour of your meal. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. It’s a handy tool for all your cooking needs.</p>  

<p>Precision is crucial when working with tahini because it’s a dense, sticky ingredient. Too much can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking depth. Whether you’re meal prepping or experimenting with new recipes, knowing that 125g tahini equals 4.41 ounces takes the guesswork out of cooking. This is especially useful for air fryer recipes, where consistency is key. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on how to use tahini in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 125g of Tahini Accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 125g of tahini. Simply place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, and spoon in the tahini until you hit 125g. If your scale displays ounces, aim for 4.41 oz. No scale? A tablespoon of tahini weighs roughly 15g, so 8 tablespoons plus a teaspoon will get you close to 125g.

<h2>Common Uses for 125g of Tahini in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Tahini is a versatile ingredient that works wonders in air fryer recipes. From marinades to dips, 125g (or 4.41 ounces) is a common quantity called for in many dishes. Try mixing it with lemon juice and garlic for a creamy dressing, or swirl it into air-fried aubergine for a Middle Eastern twist. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love how tahini adds richness without overpowering other flavours. It’s also a great base for vegan sauces, giving them a velvety texture.</p>  

<p>Another fantastic use for 125g of tahini is in baking. Air fryer tahini cookies are a crowd-pleaser, and this quantity is often the perfect amount for a batch. The nutty flavour pairs beautifully with honey or dark chocolate. For savoury options, tahini-crusted chicken or fish is a game-changer. The precise measurement ensures the coating sticks perfectly. Don’t forget to check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your air fryer in top shape after cooking with sticky ingredients like tahini.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Tahini After Measuring 125g</h3>  
<p>Once you’ve measured out 125g of tahini, storing the rest properly is key to maintaining its freshness. Always stir the tahini well before sealing the jar to prevent oil separation. Keep it in a cool, dark place, and it’ll last for months. If you’re unsure how to use up the remainder, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> offer plenty of ideas for incorporating tahini into your meals. Roasted carrots or crispy chickpeas with a tahini drizzle are always a hit.</p>

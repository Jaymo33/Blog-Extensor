<p>335 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 1.42 cups in the US or 1.18 cups in the UK. Whether you're preparing a soup, stew, or an air fryer dish, accurate measurements ensure the best results. Understanding these conversions helps avoid recipe mishaps, especially when using appliances like air fryers where precision matters. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of chicken broth can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal might turn out dry; too much, and it could become overly soggy. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on balanced moisture levels for crispy, even cooking. Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken-based dish</a> or a hearty stew, 335 ml of chicken broth needs to be measured correctly. This ensures your food cooks evenly and retains its intended flavour.</p>  

<p>Many home cooks struggle with converting millilitres to cups, especially when recipes use different measurement systems. The difference between US and UK cup sizes adds another layer of complexity. For example, 335 ml of chicken broth is roughly 1.42 US cups but only 1.18 UK cups. Knowing this distinction helps when following international recipes or using imported cookbooks. Always double-check which cup measurement your recipe uses to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 335 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug or scale, you can still measure 335 ml of chicken broth accurately. A standard US cup holds 240 ml, so 335 ml is just under 1.5 cups. For UK cooks, a metric cup is 284 ml, making 335 ml slightly more than 1.25 cups. Use a tablespoon (15 ml) to adjust smaller quantities if needed. For more tips on measuring ingredients, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting 335 ml of Chicken Broth for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers excel at cooking with minimal liquid, so using the right amount of chicken broth is crucial. Whether you're making a marinade, glaze, or sauce, 335 ml of chicken broth should be measured precisely. Too much liquid can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too little might dry out your food. For best results, stick to the recommended measurements in your recipe.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a>, call for a light broth coating. If your recipe requires 335 ml of chicken broth, ensure you convert it correctly to cups. This small detail can significantly impact texture and taste. Always use a clear measuring cup for liquids to avoid guesswork and ensure consistency.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Chicken Broth</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is confusing fluid ounces with millilitres, leading to incorrect measurements. Another is using dry measuring cups for liquids, which can result in inaccuracies. When measuring 335 ml of chicken broth, always use a liquid measuring cup placed on a flat surface. Eye-balling the amount is risky, especially in air fryer cooking where precision is key.

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cup sizes affects how 335 ml of chicken broth is measured. In the US, a cup is 240 ml, while in the UK, it’s 284 ml. This means 335 ml converts to 1.42 US cups but only 1.18 UK cups. Always check which standard your recipe follows to avoid errors. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where liquid ratios impact cooking performance.</p>  

<p>If you're adapting a recipe from a UK source, adjust the measurements accordingly. For example, if a British recipe calls for 335 ml of chicken broth, you’ll need slightly more in US cups. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion guide</a>, simplifies the process. This ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<p>4 tablespoons of BBQ sauce weigh approximately 60 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the best texture and flavour. Whether you're marinating chicken or glazing ribs, knowing the exact weight helps avoid overly saucy or dry results. For more air fryer conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so ingredient quantities directly affect cooking times and textures. Too much BBQ sauce can make food soggy, while too little leaves it dry. Measuring 4 tbsp of BBQ sauce in grams ensures consistency, especially for recipes like sticky wings or glazed salmon. If you love saucy dishes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>BBQ sauce recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Different BBQ sauce brands vary slightly in density, but 60 grams is a reliable average. Thicker sauces might weigh a tad more, while lighter ones could be closer to 55 grams. For perfect results, use a kitchen scale—especially when adapting oven recipes for your air fryer. Need cleaning tips? Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a> keeps your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Converting Tablespoons to Grams for BBQ Sauce</h3>  
<p>Since 1 tbsp of BBQ sauce equals roughly 15 grams, scaling up is simple. For 4 tbsp of BBQ sauce to grams, multiply 15 by 4, giving you 60 grams. This conversion works for most liquid or semi-liquid ingredients in air fryer cooking. If you're prepping a big batch, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> make life easier.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 4 Tbsp of BBQ Sauce</h2>  
<p>Four tablespoons of BBQ sauce (60 grams) is ideal for marinating 2–3 chicken breasts or coating a rack of ribs. It’s also perfect for glazing meatballs or tofu in the air fryer. For crispy results, brush sauce in the last 5 minutes of cooking. Craving variety? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> with different sauce quantities.</p>  

<p>If you’re reheating leftovers, 4 tbsp of BBQ sauce refreshes flavours without overpowering. Spread it evenly to avoid pooling, which can steam instead of crisp food. Remember, air fryers intensify flavours, so adjust seasoning accordingly. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> homepage.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Sticky Ingredients</h3>  
<p>To measure 4 tbsp of BBQ sauce cleanly, lightly grease your spoon or use a silicone spatula. For grams, tare your scale with the container before adding sauce. If scaling recipes, note that 4 tbsp of BBQ sauce in grams (60g) equals ¼ cup. Thinner sauces pour easily, while thicker ones may need levelling with a knife.</p>

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Knowing the weight in pounds helps you estimate cooking times more accurately, as most air fryer recipes provide timing guidelines based on weight. Heavier portions generally require longer cooking, so converting 3 kg to pounds (6.61) gives you a better starting point. This prevents undercooking or overcooking, ensuring perfectly juicy chicken thighs every time. Always use a meat thermometer to confirm doneness regardless of weight."

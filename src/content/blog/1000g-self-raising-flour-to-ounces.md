Whether you're making cakes, bread, or other treats, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert Grams to Ounces for Self-Raising Flour?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams as the standard measurement. However, some kitchen scales or older recipes might still reference ounces. Converting 1000g of self-raising flour to ounces ensures accuracy, whether you're following a classic recipe or experimenting with new ideas.

<p>Self-raising flour is a staple in British baking, and its weight can vary slightly based on humidity and packing. That's why weighing ingredients like 1000g of self-raising flour in ounces (35.27 oz) guarantees consistency. If you're prepping multiple batches, this conversion saves time and avoids guesswork.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1000g of Self-Raising Flour Accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the best way to measure 1000g of self-raising flour. If your scale displays ounces, simply set it to 35.27 oz for precision. Scooping flour directly from the bag can lead to uneven measurements, so always spoon it into your measuring tool for accuracy.

<h2>Common Uses for 1000g of Self-Raising Flour</h2>  
<p>1000g of self-raising flour is perfect for large batches of cakes, scones, or even homemade pizza dough in your air fryer. This amount is ideal for meal prepping or baking for gatherings. If you're making smaller portions, you can easily halve or quarter the measurement (500g = 17.64 oz, 250g = 8.82 oz).</p>

<h3>Storing Self-Raising Flour for Freshness</h3>

<h2>Converting Other Flour Amounts</h2>

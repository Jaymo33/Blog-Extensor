<p>2 cups of brown sugar equals approximately 16 ounces (or 1 pound) when packed. This conversion is essential for baking and air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Brown sugar’s density means it weighs more than granulated sugar, so accurate measurements matter. Whether you’re making cookies, cakes, or glazes, knowing this conversion helps avoid kitchen mishaps. For more air fryer recipe tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate brown sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of brown sugar ensures your baked goods have the perfect texture and sweetness. Too little can leave desserts dry, while too much may make them overly dense. Air fryer recipes, like sticky toffee pudding or glazed carrots, rely on precise sugar measurements for caramelisation. Brown sugar’s moisture content also affects how it behaves in recipes, so weighing it correctly is crucial. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe section</a> for ideas that use brown sugar perfectly.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients for consistency, especially in air fryer cooking where space is limited. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, but if you’re using cups, remember to pack the brown sugar firmly. This ensures you’re getting the full 16 ounces per 2 cups. For more measurement help, see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure brown sugar correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 2 cups of brown sugar accurately, spoon it into a measuring cup and press it down firmly with the back of a spoon. This “packed” method ensures you’re getting the full weight of 16 ounces. Loose brown sugar can lead to under-measuring by up to 25%, throwing off your air fryer recipes. If your recipe calls for ounces but you only have cups, this method guarantees precision.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 cups of brown sugar</h2>  
<p>Two cups (16 ounces) of brown sugar is a standard amount for many desserts and glazes. Popular air fryer recipes like cinnamon rolls, BBQ sauces, or crumbles often require this quantity. The rich molasses flavour enhances both sweet and savoury dishes, making it a versatile ingredient. Explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> that showcase brown sugar’s depth.</p>  

<p>Beyond baking, brown sugar works wonders in marinades for air-fried meats like chicken or pork. Its caramelisation properties create delicious crispy coatings in the air fryer. Storing brown sugar properly (in an airtight container) prevents hardening, ensuring your 2-cup measurements stay consistent.

<h3>Converting other sugar measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe uses grams or kilograms, 16 ounces equals roughly 454 grams. This conversion helps when using European recipes or digital scales. Remember that brown sugar’s weight differs from powdered or white sugar, so never substitute volume measurements directly. Always check whether your air fryer recipe specifies packed or loose brown sugar for best results.</p>

<p>3 tablespoons of icing sugar equals approximately 36 grams in the UK. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. Whether you're whipping up a quick treat or following a detailed recipe, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but inaccurate measurements can lead to dry or dense results. Using the correct grams for 3 tbsp of icing sugar ensures your desserts have the right texture and sweetness. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> rely on precise measurements to achieve the best outcome.</p>  

<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 3 tbsp of icing sugar but you use too much, your dessert may become overly sweet or crumbly. On the other hand, too little can leave it bland. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because it accounts for variations in how the sugar is packed.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 3 tbsp of icing sugar correctly</h3>  
<p>To get an accurate 36 grams from 3 tbsp of icing sugar, lightly spoon the sugar into the tablespoon and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to an incorrect measurement. If you're using a kitchen scale, simply weigh out 36 grams for the perfect amount.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 3 tbsp of icing sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Three tablespoons of icing sugar (36 grams) is a common measurement in many air fryer desserts. From dusting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> to sweetening cookie dough, this amount is versatile. It's also ideal for glazes or frostings that require a light, smooth consistency.</p>  

<p>If you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a>, 3 tbsp of icing sugar can be mixed into the dough or used for decoration. For a quick dessert, try dusting air-fried fruit with this amount for a sweet finish. The possibilities are endless with precise measurements!</p>  

<h3>Converting other sugar measurements for air fryer baking</h3>  
<p>If your recipe uses cups or ounces instead of tablespoons, you can easily convert them to grams. For example, 1 cup of icing sugar is roughly 120 grams, while 1 ounce is about 28 grams. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these adjustments simple.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing and using icing sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Keep your icing sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping, which can affect measurements. If your sugar has hardened, sift it before measuring to ensure accuracy. For best results, use fresh icing sugar in your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>When working with 3 tbsp of icing sugar (36 grams), always check your recipe for specific instructions. Some desserts may require sifted sugar, while others work better with it lightly packed. Following these tips will help you achieve bakery-quality results in your air fryer.</p>

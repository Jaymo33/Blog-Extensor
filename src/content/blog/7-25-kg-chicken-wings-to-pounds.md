<h2>Cooking 7.25 kg chicken wings in your air fryer</h2>

Since most air fryer baskets hold 1-2 pounds of wings per batch, you'll need to cook in multiple rounds to avoid overcrowding. Divide your 16 pounds of wings into manageable portions, typically 1.5 pounds per batch for optimal results. Preheat your air fryer to 200°C for best performance, and cook each batch for 20-25 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through. This method ensures all wings achieve that desirable crispy texture without steaming.</p>

<p>Seasoning your 7.25 kg chicken wings before air frying enhances their flavor dramatically. You can use dry rubs or marinades, but pat the wings dry before cooking to maximize crispiness. For sauce-coated wings, toss them in sauce after air frying to maintain their crispy exterior. Since you're working with a large amount, consider seasoning in batches to ensure even coverage. Explore various seasoning ideas in the <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">recipes section at airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for inspiration.

These practices ensure your large quantity of wings remains safe and delicious throughout its use.</p>

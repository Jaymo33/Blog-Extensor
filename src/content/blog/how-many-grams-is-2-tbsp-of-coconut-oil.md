<p>Coconut oil’s density means volume measurements like tablespoons aren’t always precise. Factors like temperature (solid vs. melted) can slightly alter the weight, but 28 grams per 2 tbsp is a reliable standard.

<h3>How to measure coconut oil for air frying</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 28 grams of coconut oil. If you don’t have one, level off 2 tbsp with a knife for a close estimate. Melted coconut oil can be measured by volume, but solid oil should be packed firmly into the spoon. This ensures accuracy for air fryer recipes like roasted vegetables or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>crispy chicken</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 25g of Honey to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, making conversions a kitchen essential. Converting 25g of honey to ounces (0.88 oz) ensures accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where even small deviations can affect texture and flavour. Honey’s viscosity means measuring by weight is more reliable than volume. If you're preparing a dish like honey-glazed chicken, precise measurements guarantee the perfect balance of sweetness. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> that use honey for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Honey’s density can vary slightly depending on temperature and type, but 25g consistently translates to roughly 0.88 ounces. This makes it easier to scale recipes up or down without guesswork. For example, if a recipe calls for 50g of honey, you’ll know it’s about 1.76 ounces. Keeping a digital kitchen scale handy simplifies these conversions, but memorising common ones like 25g honey to ounces saves time. Need to clean sticky residue? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 25g of Honey Accurately</h2>  
<h3>Using a Digital Scale</h3>  
<p>A digital scale is the most precise way to measure 25g of honey. Place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then drizzle honey until it hits 25g. This method eliminates sticky measuring spoons and ensures consistency. For recipes like honey cakes or glazes, accuracy is key to achieving the desired texture. Discover delicious <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> where honey plays a starring role.</p>  

<h3>Converting Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 25g of honey is roughly 1.5 tablespoons, but this can vary based on honey thickness. For thicker varieties like manuka, it might be slightly less. While not as precise as weighing, this method works in a pinch for marinades or dressings. Remember, 25g honey to ounces is 0.88 oz, so adjust accordingly if your recipe uses imperial measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 25g of Honey in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Honey adds a touch of sweetness and caramelisation to air fryer dishes. Use 25g (0.88 oz) to glaze salmon, create sticky chicken wings, or sweeten roasted vegetables. Its natural sugars help achieve a crispy, golden finish—perfect for air frying. Try drizzling 25g of honey over air-fried carrots or parsnips for a side dish that steals the show. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Honey also works wonders in marinades. Combine 25g with soy sauce, garlic, and ginger for a quick glaze on tofu or shrimp. The air fryer’s high heat caramelises the honey, creating a glossy, flavourful coating. Since 25g of honey equals 0.88 ounces, you can easily double or halve the quantity based on your needs.

<p>985 ml of buttermilk is approximately 4.16 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using precise measurements for air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up pancakes or a tender cake, knowing how to convert 985 ml of buttermilk to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can affect your results. Buttermilk, with its unique acidity and texture, plays a crucial role in recipes. Converting 985 ml of buttermilk to cups correctly ensures your baked goods rise properly and have the right consistency. For more baking tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>.</p>

<p>Using the wrong amount of buttermilk can lead to dense cakes or overly tangy flavours. That’s why it’s important to measure 985 ml of buttermilk accurately. A digital scale or a reliable measuring cup can help, but knowing the conversion simplifies the process.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 985 ml of Buttermilk</h2>
<p>Measuring 985 ml of buttermilk is straightforward with the right tools. A liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings is ideal, but if you only have cups, remember that 985 ml equals roughly 4.16 cups. For precision, use a kitchen scale set to grams, as 985 ml of buttermilk weighs about 1010 grams.</p>

<h3>Using a Measuring Cup</h3>
<p>If you’re using a standard US measuring cup, fill it to the 240 ml mark four times, then add an additional 25 ml to reach 985 ml. This method ensures you get as close as possible to 4.16 cups. For UK bakers, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<h2>Converting 985 ml of Buttermilk in Recipes</h2>
<p>Many recipes call for buttermilk in millilitres, especially those from outside the US. Converting 985 ml of buttermilk to cups makes it easier to follow these recipes without hassle. Whether you're making fluffy pancakes or a moist cake, this conversion ensures consistency.</p>

<p>For example, if a recipe requires 985 ml of buttermilk, you can use 4 cups plus 2 tablespoons as a close approximation. This small adjustment won’t significantly alter the outcome, but for precise baking, sticking to 4.16 cups is best.

<h3>Adjusting for Different Cup Sizes</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that cup sizes vary between the US and UK. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. For 985 ml of buttermilk, the difference is minimal, but for larger quantities, it can add up. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 985 ml of Buttermilk</h2>
<p>Buttermilk is a versatile ingredient, and 985 ml is a common quantity for many recipes. From tenderising meats to adding moisture to cakes, buttermilk enhances flavour and texture. If you’re using an air fryer, buttermilk can also be used for marinating chicken or making crispy coatings.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Buttermilk</h3>
<p>If you have leftover buttermilk after measuring out 985 ml, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. It will keep for about two weeks. Alternatively, freeze it in ice cube trays for future use in smaller quantities.</p>

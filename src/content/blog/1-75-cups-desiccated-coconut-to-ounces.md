<p>1.75 cups of desiccated coconut equals approximately 5.6 ounces (or 160 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially in baking or dessert prep. Whether you're making coconut macaroons or adding texture to a dish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of desiccated coconut can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish lacks flavour; too much, and it becomes dry. Air fryers cook quickly, so ingredient ratios are crucial for even results. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Desiccated coconut is lightweight, so volume-to-weight conversions can be tricky. A kitchen scale is ideal, but if you don’t have one, this guide ensures accuracy. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for coconut, from crispy shrimp coatings to vegan desserts.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Desiccated Coconut Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you’re working without scales, fluff the coconut lightly before scooping. Packed cups yield more weight, so spoon it gently into the measuring cup. For 1.75 cups, level off the top with a knife—this avoids excess and keeps measurements precise.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Desiccated Coconut in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Desiccated coconut adds crunch and sweetness to air-fried dishes. Try it in coconut-crusted chicken, energy balls, or as a topping for air-fried fruit. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for coconut-heavy treats.</p>  

<p>It’s also great for gluten-free or keto recipes. Mix it with almond flour for a crispy coating or blend into air-fried cake batters. Cleanup is easy with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>—especially handy after sticky coconut recipes!</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off texture and flavour. Sesame seeds, though small, pack a punch in taste and nutrition. Using 0.33 cup of sesame seeds (1.6 oz) ensures your dish isn’t overpowered or lacking. If you’re experimenting with new recipes, precise measurements help replicate success. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sesame seeds for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh 0.33 cup of sesame seeds as 1.6 oz. If you don’t have a scale, lightly spoon the seeds into a measuring cup without packing them down. Too many seeds can make dishes bitter, while too few may lack crunch.

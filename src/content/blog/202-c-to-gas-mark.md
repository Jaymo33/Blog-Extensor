<p>202°C converts to Gas Mark 6 for conventional ovens and air fryers. This temperature is commonly used for baking cakes, roasting vegetables, and cooking many air fryer recipes to perfection. Understanding this conversion helps when switching between appliances or following older recipes that use Gas Mark measurements.</p>

<h2>Why 202°C to Gas Mark Conversion Matters</h2>
<p>Many British cooks still rely on Gas Mark measurements, especially when using traditional recipes or older cookbooks. When using modern appliances like air fryers that display temperatures in Celsius, knowing that 202°C equals Gas Mark 6 prevents cooking mishaps. This conversion is particularly useful for baking, where precise temperatures are crucial for successful results.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we frequently encounter questions about temperature conversions. Whether you're adapting a family recipe or trying a new dish from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake collection</a>, getting the temperature right makes all the difference. 202°C (Gas Mark 6) falls in the moderate oven range, ideal for many cooking tasks.</p>

<h2>How to Use 202°C in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Most modern air fryers allow you to set temperatures precisely to 202°C, making them excellent alternatives to conventional ovens. When converting Gas Mark recipes to air fryer cooking, remember that air fryers cook faster due to their powerful fan circulation. You might need to reduce cooking times by about 20% when using 202°C in your air fryer compared to a standard oven.</p>
<p>For perfect results at 202°C in your air fryer, consider using our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. This temperature works wonderfully for roasting vegetables from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> or baking smaller cakes and cookies. Always preheat your air fryer to 202°C for about 3 minutes before adding food for best results.</p>

<h3>Common Foods Cooked at 202°C/Gas Mark 6</h3>
<p>Many popular dishes use 202°C or Gas Mark 6 as their ideal cooking temperature. This includes Victoria sponge cakes, roast potatoes, and certain types of biscuits. When using an air fryer at this temperature, you can achieve beautifully crisp exteriors with moist interiors, especially for foods like chicken thighs or stuffed mushrooms.</p>

<h2>Gas Mark to Celsius Conversion Basics</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark scale is a British temperature measurement system for ovens, with each mark representing a specific temperature range. Gas Mark 6 corresponds to 200-210°C, with 202°C sitting comfortably in the middle of this range. This makes it easy to remember that 202°C equals Gas Mark 6 without needing complex calculations.</p>
<p>When converting other temperatures, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe section</a> includes many dishes with both Celsius and Gas Mark measurements. For cleaning your air fryer after cooking at high temperatures like 202°C, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>proper maintenance</a> to keep your appliance in top condition.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times at 202°C</h3>
<p>While 202°C converts precisely to Gas Mark 6, cooking times may vary between appliances. Air fryers typically cook faster than conventional ovens at the same temperature. For example, cookies that take 12 minutes at Gas Mark 6 in an oven might only need 9-10 minutes at 202°C in an air fryer. Always check food a few minutes before the recommended time.</p>

<h2>Historical Context of Gas Mark Measurements</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark system originated when most British homes used gas ovens without precise temperature controls. Each Gas Mark represented a specific flame size, making it easy for cooks to adjust heat without thermometers. Today, even with digital displays showing 202°C, many bakers still prefer referencing Gas Mark 6 for certain traditional recipes.</p>
<p>Modern air fryers have made temperature control more precise than ever, allowing settings like 202°C with the push of a button. However, when adapting grandmother's recipes that specify Gas Mark 6, knowing it's equivalent to 202°C helps maintain the intended cooking results. This is especially useful for delicate baked goods where temperature accuracy matters.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting 202°C Cooking</h3>
<p>If foods aren't cooking properly at 202°C/Gas Mark 6 in your air fryer, first verify the actual temperature with an oven thermometer. Air fryers can sometimes run hotter or cooler than their displays indicate. Also ensure you're not overcrowding the basket, as this affects air circulation and cooking efficiency at this temperature.</p>

<h2>Energy Efficiency at 202°C</h2>
<p>Cooking at 202°C (Gas Mark 6) in an air fryer typically uses less energy than a conventional oven at the same temperature. The smaller cooking chamber and efficient heat circulation mean you can achieve the same results faster and with lower energy consumption. This makes 202°C an economical choice for everyday cooking in your air fryer.</p>
<p>For those conscious about energy use, preparing multiple items sequentially at 202°C in your air fryer makes efficient use of the retained heat. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> offer great ideas for batch cooking at this temperature, saving both time and electricity compared to using a full-sized oven.</p>

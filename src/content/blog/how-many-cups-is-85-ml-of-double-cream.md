<p>85 ml of double cream is approximately 0.36 cups. This conversion is handy for recipes that call for precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding richness to a savoury dish, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures your recipe turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When it comes to baking or cooking, precision is key. Double cream, with its high fat content, can significantly alter the texture and taste of your dish if not measured correctly. Using 85 ml of double cream instead of the required 0.36 cups could throw off your recipe, leading to overly rich or runny results. That's why it's essential to get the conversion right, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency matters.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you quickly switch between metric and imperial units, so you never have to guess again. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a decadent dessert, precise measurements ensure success.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 85 ml of Double Cream</h2>
<p>Measuring 85 ml of double cream is straightforward if you have the right tools. A liquid measuring cup with ml markings is ideal, but if you only have cups, you'll need to convert. As mentioned, 85 ml equals roughly 0.36 cups. For best results, use a measuring jug with both ml and cup markings to avoid errors.</p>
<p>If you're using an air fryer, consider the consistency of your dish. Double cream adds richness, so even small deviations can affect the outcome. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> often call for precise amounts of double cream to achieve the perfect texture. Too much can make dishes greasy, while too little might leave them dry.</p>

<h3>Converting 85 ml of Double Cream in Different Recipes</h3>
<p>Different recipes may require slight adjustments when converting 85 ml of double cream to cups. For baking, precision is crucial, so stick to 0.36 cups. For cooking, you might have more flexibility, but it's still best to measure accurately. If you're adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for tips on adjusting measurements.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 85 ml of Double Cream</h2>
<p>Double cream is a versatile ingredient, and 85 ml (or 0.36 cups) is a common amount in many recipes. You might use it to enrich soups, create creamy pasta sauces, or whip up desserts like mousses and custards. In the air fryer, double cream can be used to make indulgent dishes like creamy garlic mushrooms or rich chocolate fondants.</p>
<p>If you're looking for inspiration, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> often include double cream for added moisture and flavour. Just remember to measure carefullyâ€”85 ml of double cream can make all the difference between a good cake and a great one.</p>

<h3>Tips for Working with Double Cream</h3>
<p>Double cream can be tricky to work with if you're not used to it. When measuring 85 ml, ensure the cream is at room temperature for accuracy. Cold cream can be thicker and harder to measure precisely. Also, avoid over-whipping, as double cream can quickly turn to butter if handled too vigorously.</p>

<h3>Why Weight Beats Volume for Lentils</h3>
<p>While cup measurements are convenient, 125 grams of lentils gives more reliable results than cup estimates. Lentils can settle or vary in shape, affecting volume measurements. For air fryer recipes requiring precision – like lentil falafels or crispy toppings – always opt for grams when possible.</p>

<h2>Converting 125g Lentils to Cups Worldwide</h2>
<p>The UK metric cup (250ml) and US customary cup (240ml) explain why 125 grams of lentils converts to different cup amounts. Australian cups (250ml) match UK measurements, while Canadian recipes may use either.

<p>For quick reference: 125g lentils equals 0.63 UK cups, 0.53 US cups, or about 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon in US measurements. These conversions apply to dry, uncooked lentils – cooked lentil volumes differ significantly due to water absorption.</p>

<h3>Measuring Lentils Without Scales</h3>
<p>If you lack scales, fluff your lentils before spooning them into a cup for the most accurate 125 grams of lentils measurement. Avoid packing them down. One UK metric cup holds about 200g of lentils, meaning 125g is roughly 3/5 of a cup.

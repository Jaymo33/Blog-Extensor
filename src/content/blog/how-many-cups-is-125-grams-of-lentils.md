<p>125 grams of lentils equals approximately 0.63 UK cups or 0.53 US cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're meal prepping or trying a new dish, knowing how many cups is 125 grams of lentils ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Lentil Measurements</h2>
<p>Lentils are a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy snacks to hearty mains. Their density means weight-to-volume conversions aren’t always straightforward. For 125 grams of lentils, UK cooks use 0.63 cups, while US measurements call for 0.53 cups due to slight cup size differences. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend weighing lentils for accuracy, especially in baking conversions where ratios matter.</p>
<p>Different lentil types (red, green, Puy) vary slightly in volume per gram. For 125g lentils in cups, we’ve averaged measurements across common varieties. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other ingredient conversions to streamline your cooking process.</p>

<h3>Why Weight Beats Volume for Lentils</h3>
<p>While cup measurements are convenient, 125 grams of lentils gives more reliable results than cup estimates. Lentils can settle or vary in shape, affecting volume measurements. For air fryer recipes requiring precision – like lentil falafels or crispy toppings – always opt for grams when possible.</p>

<h2>Converting 125g Lentils to Cups Worldwide</h2>
<p>The UK metric cup (250ml) and US customary cup (240ml) explain why 125 grams of lentils converts to different cup amounts. Australian cups (250ml) match UK measurements, while Canadian recipes may use either. When following international recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a>, always note which cup standard is referenced.</p>
<p>For quick reference: 125g lentils equals 0.63 UK cups, 0.53 US cups, or about 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon in US measurements. These conversions apply to dry, uncooked lentils – cooked lentil volumes differ significantly due to water absorption.</p>

<h3>Measuring Lentils Without Scales</h3>
<p>If you lack scales, fluff your lentils before spooning them into a cup for the most accurate 125 grams of lentils measurement. Avoid packing them down. One UK metric cup holds about 200g of lentils, meaning 125g is roughly 3/5 of a cup. See our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable category</a> for lentil-based air fryer ideas.</p>

<h2>Cooking 125 Grams of Lentils in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>When preparing 125 grams of lentils (about 0.63 UK cups), pre-soaking reduces cooking time. For crispy roasted lentils – a brilliant air fryer snack – toss soaked-and-drained lentils with oil before air frying at 180°C for 12-15 minutes. This amount yields about two snack portions or serves as a base for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that 125 grams of dried lentils expands to roughly 375g when cooked. For recipes specifying cooked lentils (like salads or stuffings), you’ll need about 42g dry lentils per 125g cooked equivalent. Always consult your air fryer manual for pulse cooking settings.</p>

<h3>Storing Measured Lentils</h3>
<p>After measuring out 125 grams of lentils, store unused dry lentils in airtight containers away from moisture. Cooked lentils keep for 3 days refrigerated – perfect for quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> meals. For best results when reheating in your air fryer, spritz with water to prevent drying out.</p>

<p>0.25 cup of brown sugar equals approximately 2 ounces (or 56.7 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and flavour. Whether you're baking cookies or glazing meats, knowing how to convert 0.25 cup of brown sugar to ounces helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much sugar can cause sticking or uneven browning, while too little might leave your dish bland. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookies</a>, 0.25 cup of brown sugar (2 ounces) adds the right sweetness without overwhelming the dough. Always use a kitchen scale for the best results, especially with sticky ingredients like brown sugar.</p>  

<p>If you're adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements. This ensures your dishes turn out just as delicious as oven-baked versions.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.25 Cup of Brown Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>Brown sugar should be packed firmly into the measuring cup to avoid air gaps. Scoop it in and press down lightly with a spoon, then level off the top. For 0.25 cup, this method guarantees you’ll get the full 2 ounces needed for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.25 Cup of Brown Sugar</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty measurement is perfect for glazes, marinades, or single-serving treats. Try it in an air fryer caramelised banana or a quick barbecue rub for chicken. Since air fryers cook faster than ovens, the sugar caramelises beautifully without burning.</p>

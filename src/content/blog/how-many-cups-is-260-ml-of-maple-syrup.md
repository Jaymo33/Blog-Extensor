<p>260 ml of maple syrup is approximately 1.1 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up pancakes or glazing salmon in your air fryer, knowing this measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Maple Syrup Measurements</h2>
<p>Maple syrup is thicker than water, so its volume-to-weight ratio differs slightly. While 260 ml of water is roughly 1.1 cups, maple syrup's density means it might feel slightly more substantial. This is crucial for recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> where exact measurements affect texture and taste.</p>
<p>For air fryer cooking, especially with desserts or glazes, the right amount of maple syrup ensures even caramelisation. Too much can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. Always measure carefully for consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why 260 ml of Maple Syrup Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, call for specific amounts of maple syrup. Whether you're making candied nuts or glazing vegetables, 260 ml (or 1.1 cups) is a common quantity. This measurement helps achieve the perfect balance of sweetness without overpowering other ingredients.</p>
<p>The air fryer's intense heat means syrups caramelise quickly. Using precisely 260 ml of maple syrup ensures even coating and prevents burning. This is especially important for delicate items like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> where timing and temperature are critical.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring 260 ml of Maple Syrup Accurately</h2>

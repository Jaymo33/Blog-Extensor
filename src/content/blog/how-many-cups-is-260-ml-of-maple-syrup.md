    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "260 ml (1.1 cups) is a common quantity that provides enough sweetness without overwhelming other flavours. In an air fryer, this amount caramelises perfectly without making food too sticky. The high heat intensifies the syrup's flavour, so precise measurement prevents over-sweetening."

<p>260 ml of maple syrup is approximately 1.1 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up pancakes or glazing salmon in your air fryer, knowing this measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Maple Syrup Measurements</h2>
<p>Maple syrup is thicker than water, so its volume-to-weight ratio differs slightly. While 260 ml of water is roughly 1.1 cups, maple syrup's density means it might feel slightly more substantial. This is crucial for recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> where exact measurements affect texture and taste.</p>
<p>For air fryer cooking, especially with desserts or glazes, the right amount of maple syrup ensures even caramelisation. Too much can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. Always measure carefully for consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why 260 ml of Maple Syrup Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, call for specific amounts of maple syrup. Whether you're making candied nuts or glazing vegetables, 260 ml (or 1.1 cups) is a common quantity. This measurement helps achieve the perfect balance of sweetness without overpowering other ingredients.</p>
<p>The air fryer's intense heat means syrups caramelise quickly. Using precisely 260 ml of maple syrup ensures even coating and prevents burning. This is especially important for delicate items like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> where timing and temperature are critical.</p>

<h3>Converting 260 ml of Maple Syrup to Other Measurements</h3>
<p>If you don't have measuring cups, 260 ml of maple syrup equals about 17.5 tablespoons. For weight, it's approximately 340 grams. These conversions are handy when using kitchen scales or adjusting batch sizes for popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring 260 ml of Maple Syrup Accurately</h2>
<p>To measure 260 ml of maple syrup precisely, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Coat the cup with a light oil spray first - this helps the syrup pour out cleanly without sticking. For sticky ingredients like maple syrup, this small step makes a big difference in accuracy.</p>
<p>When working with your air fryer, consider that 260 ml of maple syrup will reduce slightly during cooking. Factor this into recipes where thickness matters, like sauces for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>. The concentrated flavour can be powerful, so measure carefully.</p>

<h3>Common Recipes Using 260 ml of Maple Syrup</h3>
<p>Many air fryer favourites use around 260 ml of maple syrup. From glazed carrots to maple-roasted nuts, this quantity delivers balanced sweetness. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> helps adjust these recipes if you need to scale quantities up or down while maintaining perfect proportions.</p>

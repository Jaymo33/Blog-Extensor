<p>460 ml of coconut milk is approximately 1.94 cups in the US or 1.62 cups in the UK. Whether you're whipping up a curry or baking a dessert in your air fryer, precise measurements matter. Coconut milk's rich texture means even small measurement errors can affect your dish. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every recipe with accurate conversions.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Coconut Milk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Coconut milk adds creaminess to dishes, but too much or too little can throw off your recipe. Air fryer cooking relies on precise ratios, especially for sauces and batters. A 460 ml measurement is common in many recipes, so knowing its cup equivalent is key. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>Thai curry recipe</a> uses this exact amount for perfect consistency. Always measure coconut milk properly to avoid soggy or dry results.</p>  

<p>Different brands of coconut milk vary in thickness, so measuring by volume (ml or cups) is more reliable than eyeballing. If you're using canned coconut milk, shake it well before measuring. For air fryer desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>coconut cakes</a>, 460 ml provides just the right moisture.

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The US and UK use slightly different cup sizes, which affects the 460 ml conversion. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, making 460 ml roughly 1.94 cups. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, so 460 ml equals about 1.62 cups. Always check your recipe's origin to avoid mistakes. For air fryer cooking, even small differences can impact texture and cooking time.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 460 ml of Coconut Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard kitchen tools to approximate 460 ml of coconut milk. A US cup holds 240 ml, so 1 full cup plus another ¾ cup gets you close. For UK cooks, 1.5 cups (426 ml) plus a tablespoon (15 ml) lands near 460 ml.

<p>Canned coconut milk often comes in 400 ml tins. To reach 460 ml, add another 60 ml (¼ US cup or 3 UK tablespoons). Stir well to blend any separated cream. For dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>coconut pudding</a>, this extra liquid ensures smoothness. Always level off measurements with a knife for accuracy.</p>

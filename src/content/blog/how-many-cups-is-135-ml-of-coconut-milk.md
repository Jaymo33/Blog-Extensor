<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of coconut milk can affect the texture and flavour of your dish. Too much liquid might make your food soggy, while too little could dry it out. The air fryer’s intense heat means ingredients like coconut milk need to be measured precisely. For example, 135 ml of coconut milk in cups is roughly 0.57, which is just over half a cup. This small difference can be crucial in recipes like Thai curries or coconut-based desserts.</p>

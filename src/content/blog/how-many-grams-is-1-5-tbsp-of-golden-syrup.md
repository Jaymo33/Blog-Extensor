<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of golden syrup equals approximately 31 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're baking a cake or glazing meats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. Golden syrup’s thick, sticky consistency means volume measurements can vary, so grams are far more reliable. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions must be spot-on. Too much golden syrup can lead to overly sticky or burnt results, while too little might leave dishes lacking flavour. Recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> often use grams for precision, especially in baking. Measuring by weight also saves time—no need to level off tablespoons or worry about packing. If you love desserts, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for more sweet inspiration.</p>

<p>Golden syrup’s density means 1.5 tbsp won’t always weigh the same as other liquids. Factors like temperature and how you fill the spoon can affect volume measurements. That’s why professional chefs and home cooks alike prefer weighing ingredients. For sticky substances like golden syrup, lightly greasing your measuring spoon helps it slide off easily. This trick is handy when prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>How to convert 1.5 tbsp golden syrup to grams</h2>
<p>The simplest method is using digital kitchen scales for accuracy. Place your mixing bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add golden syrup until it reads 31g. If you don’t have scales, remember that 1 tbsp of golden syrup is roughly 20.5g, so 1.5 tbsp totals about 31g. This conversion works for UK tablespoons, which differ slightly from US measurements.

<h3>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>Golden syrup adds moisture and caramelised sweetness to air-fried goods. It’s perfect for glazing ham, baking flapjacks, or making sticky toffee pudding. Its high sugar content helps create crispy exteriors while keeping interiors tender. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for a delicious twist on classic dishes. Just remember—31g of golden syrup equals 1.5 tbsp when following UK measurements.</p>

<h2>Tips for working with golden syrup</h2>
<p>Warm your spoon in hot water before scooping golden syrup—it’ll slide off more easily. Store opened tins in a cool, dry place to prevent crystallisation. If your syrup hardens, gently warm the tin in hot water to restore its pourable consistency. Always measure over a bowl to catch drips, and wipe the spoon clean between uses. For sticky messes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips.</p>

<p>When substituting golden syrup in recipes, note that honey or maple syrup have different weights per tablespoon. This affects air fryer cooking times and textures, so adjust accordingly. For savoury dishes needing a touch of sweetness, golden syrup works wonders in marinades too. Its distinct butterscotch flavour enhances everything from roasted vegetables to glazed chicken wings.</p>

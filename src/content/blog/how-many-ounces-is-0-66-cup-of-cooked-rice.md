<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients, like 0.66 cup of cooked rice, ensures even cooking and optimal texture. Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so overcrowding or underfilling can affect results. For example, 5.28 ounces of rice fits perfectly in most air fryer baskets without clumping.

<p>Measuring 0.66 cup of cooked rice to ounces also helps with portion control. Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, consistency is key.

<h3>How to Measure 0.66 Cup of Cooked Rice Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, fluff the rice lightly before scooping it into a measuring cup. Fill the cup just over halfway to approximate 0.66 cup, then level it off. Remember, 5.28 ounces is the weight, not volume, so packing the rice too tightly will skew results.

<h2>Common Uses for 0.66 Cup of Cooked Rice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

<h3>Converting Other Rice Measurements to Ounces</h3>

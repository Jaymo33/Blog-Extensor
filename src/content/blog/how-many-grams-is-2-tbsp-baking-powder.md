<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of baking powder is equivalent to approximately 28 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up cakes, bread, or even savoury dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and even small discrepancies in measurements can affect the texture and rise of your baked goods. In an air fryer, where heat distribution is rapid, precise quantities ensure even cooking. Too much baking powder can cause excessive browning or a bitter taste, while too little may leave your dish dense. For foolproof recipes, always measure by weight when possible. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for perfectly measured dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2 tbsp of baking powder accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 2 tbsp baking powder to grams, use a digital kitchen scale. Scoop the baking powder lightly into the tablespoon without packing it down, then level it off. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tbsp of baking powder weighs roughly 14 grams, so 2 tbsp equals 28 grams. This method works for UK measurements and ensures consistency across recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp of baking powder in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Two tablespoons of baking powder (28g) is often used in larger batches of cakes, muffins, or even savoury dishes like air-fried onion rings. It’s a key ingredient in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>, helping them rise beautifully. If you’re adapting an oven recipe for the air fryer, sticking to the correct grams ensures the texture stays light and fluffy. Always sift baking powder to avoid clumps, especially in air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h3>Converting other baking powder quantities to grams</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 2 tbsp, here’s a quick guide: 1 tbsp = 14g, 3 tbsp = 42g, and ½ tbsp = 7g. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down.

<h2>Tips for storing baking powder for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>To keep your baking powder fresh and effective, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Humidity can cause clumping, which affects measurement accuracy. Check the expiry date regularly, as old baking powder loses its leavening power.

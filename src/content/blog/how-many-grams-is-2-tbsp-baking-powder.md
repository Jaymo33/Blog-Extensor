<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and even small discrepancies in measurements can affect the texture and rise of your baked goods. In an air fryer, where heat distribution is rapid, precise quantities ensure even cooking. Too much baking powder can cause excessive browning or a bitter taste, while too little may leave your dish dense. For foolproof recipes, always measure by weight when possible. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for perfectly measured dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2 tbsp of baking powder accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 2 tbsp baking powder to grams, use a digital kitchen scale. Scoop the baking powder lightly into the tablespoon without packing it down, then level it off. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tbsp of baking powder weighs roughly 14 grams, so 2 tbsp equals 28 grams. This method works for UK measurements and ensures consistency across recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp of baking powder in air fryer recipes</h2>

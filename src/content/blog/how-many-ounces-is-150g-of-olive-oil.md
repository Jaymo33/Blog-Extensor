<p>150g of olive oil is approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re drizzling oil over roasted vegetables or marinating chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy in cooking, especially when using an air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why converting 150g of olive oil to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in air fryer cooking because the appliance relies on even heat distribution. Too much or too little olive oil can affect texture and crispiness.

<p>Olive oil is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from Mediterranean-style vegetables to herb-infused chicken. Knowing how many ounces are in 150g ensures you don’t over-saturate your ingredients. This precision is especially important for recipes like air-fried tofu or crispy shrimp, where excess oil can lead to soggy results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 150g of olive oil without scales</h3>

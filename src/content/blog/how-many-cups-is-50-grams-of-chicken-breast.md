<h3>How to Measure 50 Grams of Chicken Breast</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, using cups is a handy alternative. Start by dicing or shredding the chicken breast finely for the most accurate measurement. A packed 0.25 cups of chopped chicken will roughly equal 50 grams. For larger batches, multiply accordingly—100 grams would be about 0.5 cups. Always fluff the chicken lightly in the cup to avoid overpacking.</p>  

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Different Cuts</h2>  
<p>The density of chicken breast can vary based on how it’s prepared. For example, 50 grams of ground chicken breast may measure slightly more than 0.25 cups due to its finer texture. Conversely, larger chunks might take up less space in a cup. If you’re working with frozen chicken, thaw it completely before measuring for accuracy.

<p>When adapting recipes from grams to cups, consider the cooking method. Air frying requires even distribution for optimal crispiness, so precise measurements matter. If a recipe calls for 50 grams of chicken breast and you’re using cups, err on the side of slightly less to avoid overcrowding.

This precision is why professional chefs and home cooks alike swear by measuring liquids in millilitres.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.25 Cups of Beef Stock Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a liquid measuring cup with ml markings. Fill it to the 1.25-cup line, then check the corresponding ml measurement. If your cup only has imperial units, remember that 1 cup equals 236.59 ml, so 1.25 cups is roughly 295.74 ml. This method eliminates guesswork, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency is key.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.25 Cups of Beef Stock in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

<p>Another popular use is creating sauces or gravies to accompany air-fried dishes. The concentrated flavour of beef stock enhances pan drippings beautifully.

<h2>Tips for Working with Beef Stock in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>When using beef stock in your air fryer, opt for low-sodium varieties to better control seasoning. The concentrated heat of air frying can intensify saltiness, so starting with a milder base allows for adjustments later. This is particularly important when reducing sauces or making glazes.</p>  

<p>For best results, deglaze your air fryer basket with a splash of beef stock after cooking meats. This loosens flavorful browned bits for easy cleaning while creating an instant sauce base.

<h3>Storing Leftover Beef Stock</h3>

Each cube typically holds about 30 ml, making it easy to portion small amounts for air fryer recipes. This prevents waste and ensures you always have stock on hand for impromptu cooking sessions.</p>

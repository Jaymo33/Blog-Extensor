<p>25 grams of hot sauce equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that list ingredients in grams but require ounces for measurement. Whether you're whipping up spicy wings or a tangy marinade, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out just right.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 25g of Hot Sauce to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use metric measurements, but some kitchen scales or recipes might list weights in ounces. Converting 25g of hot sauce to ounces (0.88 oz) helps maintain accuracy, especially when precision matters for flavour balance. Hot sauce can vary in density, so using a scale is ideal, but this conversion gives you a reliable starting point.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using a digital scale for the best results. If you're working with a recipe from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section, this conversion ensures you won’t overpower your dish with too much heat. A little hot sauce goes a long way, so measuring correctly is key!</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 25g of Hot Sauce Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can estimate 25g of hot sauce using volume measurements. Roughly, 25g is about 1.5 tablespoons, but this can vary based on the sauce’s thickness. For thicker sauces like sriracha, it might be slightly less, while runnier sauces could measure closer to 2 tablespoons.</p>  
<p>Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps. Whether you're cooking spicy chicken or marinating tofu, precise measurements make all the difference. And remember, you can always adjust to taste—especially with hot sauce!</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 25g of Hot Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>25g of hot sauce is perfect for marinating chicken wings, glazing shrimp, or adding a kick to roasted vegetables. It’s also a great amount for mixing into dips or drizzling over air-fried potatoes. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Hot Sauce in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Hot sauce can caramelise quickly in the air fryer, so it’s best to add it towards the end of cooking or mix it with oil to prevent burning. For sticky glazes, brush the sauce on in thin layers and air fry at a slightly lower temperature. Always clean your air fryer basket promptly—check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for tips.</p>  
<p>Experimenting with 25g of hot sauce? Start with less if you’re sensitive to heat, then adjust. The air fryer’s intense heat can amplify spiciness, so taste as you go. And don’t forget—proper measurement ensures consistent results every time!</p>

<h2>Why converting honey measurements matters</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of honey in your air fryer recipes ensures balanced flavours and textures. Too much honey can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them lacking. Measuring by weight (grams) is more accurate than volume (tablespoons), especially for thick ingredients like honey. If you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>honey-glazed chicken recipe</a>, precise measurements guarantee the perfect caramelisation. Always level off your tablespoons for the most accurate results.</p>  

<p>Honey’s density can vary slightly depending on its type and temperature, but 3 tbsp generally equals 63 grams.

<h2>How to measure honey accurately</h2>

Pour the honey slowly into the spoon until it’s level with the rim, then weigh it. For sticky ingredients like honey, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>quick clean-up</a> is essential to avoid residue buildup in your air fryer.</p>

For recipes requiring exact measurements, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, weighing is always best.

<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of honey weigh approximately 63 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're drizzling honey over roasted vegetables or using it in a glaze for chicken, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why converting honey measurements matters</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of honey in your air fryer recipes ensures balanced flavours and textures. Too much honey can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them lacking. Measuring by weight (grams) is more accurate than volume (tablespoons), especially for thick ingredients like honey. If you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>honey-glazed chicken recipe</a>, precise measurements guarantee the perfect caramelisation. Always level off your tablespoons for the most accurate results.</p>  

<p>Honey’s density can vary slightly depending on its type and temperature, but 3 tbsp generally equals 63 grams. For sticky ingredients like honey, weighing eliminates the mess of scooping and scraping. If you’re scaling up a recipe, converting to grams makes calculations easier. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more tips on measuring tricky ingredients.</p>  

<h2>How to measure honey accurately</h2>  
<p>To measure 3 tbsp of honey in grams, use a digital kitchen scale for the best accuracy. Lightly grease your measuring spoon with oil to help the honey slide off easily. Pour the honey slowly into the spoon until it’s level with the rim, then weigh it. For sticky ingredients like honey, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>quick clean-up</a> is essential to avoid residue buildup in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Alternative methods</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 1 tbsp of honey weighs roughly 21 grams, so 3 tbsp equals 63 grams. However, this can vary slightly based on honey thickness. For recipes requiring exact measurements, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, weighing is always best. Store honey in a cool, dry place to maintain consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 3 tbsp of honey in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Three tablespoons of honey (63g) is perfect for glazing meats, sweetening marinades, or drizzling over roasted veggies. Try it in a honey-mustard glaze for salmon or as a natural sweetener in air-fried granola. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Honey’s natural sugars caramelise beautifully in the air fryer, adding depth to dishes. Use 3 tbsp to balance spicy or tangy flavours in sauces. Remember, honey burns faster than sugar, so adjust cooking times accordingly. Keep experimenting to find your perfect sweet spot!</p>

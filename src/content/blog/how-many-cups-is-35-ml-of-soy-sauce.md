<p>35 ml of soy sauce equals roughly 0.15 cups (or just under 1/6 of a cup). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or whipping up a stir-fry, knowing this conversion ensures your meals turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of soy sauce is crucial for balancing flavours in your dishes. Too much can overpower, while too little might leave your meal tasting bland. In air fryer cooking, where sauces reduce quickly, precision is even more important. For example, a recipe like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer teriyaki chicken</a> relies on the perfect soy sauce ratio for that glossy, umami-rich glaze.</p>  

<p>Using 35 ml of soy sauce (0.15 cups) ensures consistency, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week. If you're scaling up a recipe, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for easy adjustments. This small measurement can make a big difference in dishes like stir-fries, marinades, or even dipping sauces.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 35 ml of Soy Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use a tablespoon for accuracy. Since 1 tablespoon equals about 15 ml, 35 ml is just over 2 tablespoons (2 tbsp + 1 tsp). For air fryer recipes, this method works well when prepping ingredients like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a>, where even distribution matters.</p>  

<h2>Converting 35 ml of Soy Sauce for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're following a UK or US recipe, 35 ml of soy sauce remains the same—roughly 0.15 cups. However, cup sizes can vary slightly by region, so always double-check if precision is key. For baking, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer soy-glazed cakes</a>, even a small variance can affect texture.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with frozen ingredients, such as <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>air fryer frozen dumplings</a>, a precise soy sauce measurement ensures the perfect dipping sauce consistency. Remember, air fryers intensify flavours as liquids reduce, so sticking to 35 ml (0.15 cups) prevents over-seasoning.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>One mistake is eyeballing liquid measurements, which often leads to uneven flavours. Another is using dirty measuring tools—residual oils or sauces can throw off accuracy. Always clean your air fryer accessories, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer baskets</a>, to avoid flavour transfer.</p>

<p>75g of fish sauce equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes that require precise measurements to achieve the perfect balance of flavours. Whether you're marinating chicken or adding a umami kick to vegetables, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out just right. For more air fryer conversion tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of fish sauce can make or break your dish. Too little, and you’ll miss the depth of flavour; too much, and it can overpower other ingredients. The air fryer’s intense heat means flavours concentrate quickly, so precision is key. Fish sauce, a staple in many Asian-inspired dishes, is often measured in grams, but many UK recipes use ounces. Converting 75g of fish sauce to ounces (2.65 oz) ensures you’re following the recipe correctly. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> to put your measurements to the test.</p>  

<p>Fish sauce is a versatile ingredient, perfect for marinating proteins like chicken or tofu. A 75g (2.65 oz) portion is often used in sauces or dressings for air-fried dishes. If you’re unsure about conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies the process. Accurate measurements also help avoid waste, ensuring you use just the right amount for your meal.</p>  

<h3>How to measure fish sauce without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 75g of fish sauce using volume. Roughly, 75g is about 5 tablespoons, but this can vary slightly depending on the brand’s density. For precise air fryer cooking, we recommend investing in a digital scale. Alternatively, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> for more tips on measuring without scales.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 75g of fish sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce adds a savoury depth to many air fryer dishes. A 75g (2.65 oz) portion is ideal for marinating chicken wings or glazing salmon fillets. It’s also a key ingredient in dipping sauces for spring rolls or dumplings. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon recipes</a> to see how fish sauce enhances flavours.</p>  

<p>When using fish sauce in the air fryer, remember that a little goes a long way. The high heat intensifies the saltiness, so 75g (2.65 oz) is often enough for 4-6 servings. If you’re new to cooking with fish sauce, start with smaller amounts and adjust to taste. Clean your air fryer basket afterwards with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove any lingering odours.</p>  

<h3>Storing fish sauce for long-lasting freshness</h3>  
<p>Fish sauce has a long shelf life but should be stored in a cool, dark place. Once opened, it can last up to a year if sealed tightly. A 75g (2.65 oz) portion is often part of a larger bottle, so proper storage ensures you can use it in multiple air fryer recipes.

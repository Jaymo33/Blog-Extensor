<p>0.25 cup of tomato paste equals approximately 2 ounces. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes, where precise ingredient quantities can make or break a dish. Whether you’re making a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing this conversion ensures consistency. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much tomato paste might make your dish overly thick, while too little could leave it lacking flavour. This is especially important for recipes like meatballs or stuffed peppers, where balance is key. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of inspiration. Always measure ingredients like tomato paste carefully for the best outcome.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so small variations can have a big impact. Using 2 ounces (0.25 cup) ensures your dish has the right consistency and taste. For dishes like air fryer lasagna or stuffed mushrooms, this precision is vital. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for ideas on how to use tomato paste effectively.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.25 cup of tomato paste accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for the most precise measurement. Scoop the tomato paste into the cup and level it off with a straight edge. If you don’t have a measuring cup, 2 ounces is roughly four tablespoons. For sticky ingredients like tomato paste, spraying your measuring spoon with oil can help it slide out easily. Clean your tools promptly with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 0.25 cup of tomato paste</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for this amount of tomato paste. Think homemade pizza sauces, marinades for chicken, or even a rich base for air-fried meatloaf. The concentrated flavour of tomato paste enhances dishes without adding excess liquid. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> that often use this ingredient.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is also great for adding depth to vegetable dishes. Try it in air-fried stuffed peppers or as a glaze for roasted carrots. The 2-ounce measurement ensures the flavour isn’t overpowering. Remember, a little goes a long way with this ingredient. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>homepage</a> for more cooking tips and tricks.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover tomato paste, transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate. It will keep for about a week, or you can freeze it in ice cube trays for longer storage. Each cube is roughly one tablespoon, making future measurements easy. This way, you’ll always have the right amount for your next air fryer creation.</p>

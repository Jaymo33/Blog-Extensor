<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much tomato paste might make your dish overly thick, while too little could leave it lacking flavour. This is especially important for recipes like meatballs or stuffed peppers, where balance is key. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of inspiration. Always measure ingredients like tomato paste carefully for the best outcome.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so small variations can have a big impact. Using 2 ounces (0.25 cup) ensures your dish has the right consistency and taste. For dishes like air fryer lasagna or stuffed mushrooms, this precision is vital.

<h3>How to measure 0.25 cup of tomato paste accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for the most precise measurement. Scoop the tomato paste into the cup and level it off with a straight edge. If you don’t have a measuring cup, 2 ounces is roughly four tablespoons. For sticky ingredients like tomato paste, spraying your measuring spoon with oil can help it slide out easily.

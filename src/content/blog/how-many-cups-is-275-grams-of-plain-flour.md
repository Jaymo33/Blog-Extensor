<p>275 grams of plain flour is approximately 2.2 cups in the UK and 2.3 cups in the US. This slight difference is due to variations in cup sizes between regions. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing air fryer recipes, getting the measurement right is crucial for perfect results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, especially when converting grams to cups for consistent baking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of flour ensures your baked goods have the right texture and structure. Too much flour can make cakes dense, while too little may cause them to collapse. For air fryer recipes like doughnuts or muffins, precise measurements help achieve that light, fluffy consistency. If you're unsure about conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<p>Measuring by weight (grams) is more accurate than volume (cups) because flour can settle or be packed differently. A kitchen scale is ideal, but if you only have cups, fluff the flour first before spooning it in. This prevents over-measuring and keeps your recipes consistent.

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of plain flour is roughly 120 grams, meaning 275 grams equals about 2.2 cups. In the US, a cup is slightly larger at 125 grams, so 275 grams is closer to 2.3 cups. This small difference can impact recipes, so always check where the recipe originates. For air fryer baking, sticking to grams is often easier for precision.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 275 Grams Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Lightly fluff the flour in its bag, then spoon it into a measuring cup without packing it down. Level off the excess with a knife for a consistent measurement. This method works well for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or cookies.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 275 Grams of Flour</h2>  
<p>Many classic recipes call for around 275 grams of plain flour. This includes Victoria sponge cakes, scones, and air fryer pizza dough. For a quick treat, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a>, which often use this measurement for perfect consistency. Remember, slight adjustments may be needed based on humidity and flour type.</p>  

<h3>Storing Flour for Freshness</h3>  
<p>Keep plain flour in an airtight container to prevent moisture absorption, which can affect measurements. If your flour feels damp, fluff it well before measuring. For long-term storage, freeze flour in sealed bags—just bring it to room temperature before baking. Clean your storage containers regularly with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to avoid cross-contamination.</p>

<p>250g of lime juice equals approximately 8.82 ounces. This conversion is handy when preparing marinades, dressings, or glazes for air fryer recipes, ensuring you get the perfect balance of acidity and flavour. Whether you're whipping up a zesty chicken dish or a tangy dessert, knowing how to convert grams to ounces takes the guesswork out of cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why convert 250g lime juice to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use metric measurements, but some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might still list ingredients in ounces. Converting 250g of lime juice to ounces (8.82 oz) ensures accuracy, especially when working with strong flavours like citrus. Too much lime juice can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Lime juice is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from Mexican-inspired dishes to Asian marinades. Whether you're making crispy chicken wings or a refreshing dessert, precise measurements matter. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 250g lime juice accurately</h3>  
<p>For the best results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh lime juice directly in grams. If your scale only measures ounces, aim for 8.82 oz. Alternatively, 250g of lime juice is roughly 1 cup (240ml), but this can vary slightly depending on the juicing method. Freshly squeezed lime juice may contain pulp, which can affect the weight, so straining it first ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 250g lime juice in air frying</h2>  
<p>Lime juice adds brightness to meats, seafood, and vegetables in the air fryer. A 250g portion is perfect for marinating a whole chicken, creating a citrus glaze for salmon, or dressing a vibrant slaw. For recipe ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/seafood>seafood collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using citrus-based recipes is essential to prevent residue buildup. A mix of lime juice and baking soda can even help remove stubborn grease. For more tips, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer spotless</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover lime juice</h3>  
<p>If you don’t use all 250g of lime juice at once, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Freezing lime juice in ice cube trays is another great way to preserve it for future air fryer recipes. Just thaw and measure as needed.</p>

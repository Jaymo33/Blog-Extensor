<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of honey equals approximately 85 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're glazing chicken, sweetening desserts, or creating sticky marinades, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate honey measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking and balanced flavours, so measuring ingredients like honey correctly is crucial. Too much honey can cause burning or uneven caramelisation, while too little might leave your dish lacking sweetness. For recipes like honey-glazed salmon or sticky chicken wings, 85 grams of honey (4 tbsp) delivers the ideal balance.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using digital scales for accuracy. While volume measurements (like tablespoons) are convenient, weight measurements (grams) eliminate guesswork. This is especially helpful for sticky ingredients like honey that can cling to measuring spoons.</p>

<h2>How to measure 4 tbsp of honey without scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, you can still measure 4 tbsp of honey accurately. Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level off the honey with a straight edge. Remember that honey’s thickness means it won’t pour like water – warming the spoon slightly can help it slide off more easily.</p>
<p>For sticky situations, try coating your measuring spoon with a light oil spray first. This little trick from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning guide</a> makes cleanup easier too. When converting 4 tbsp honey to grams, note that different honey varieties (like manuka or set honey) may vary slightly in weight.</p>

<h2>Tips for working with honey in your air fryer</h2>
<p>Honey can burn quickly in the air fryer’s intense heat. To prevent this, mix it with oil or water when making glazes, and apply during the last few minutes of cooking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>honey chicken recipes</a> use this technique for perfect caramelisation.</p>
<p>Remember that 4 tbsp of honey (85g) contains about 258 calories, so adjust your portions accordingly. For healthier alternatives, you could reduce the quantity slightly or mix with mustard or vinegar for tangy-sweet sauces. The air fryer’s efficiency means you’ll need less honey than traditional oven cooking.</p>

<p>185 ml of heavy cream is approximately 0.78 cups (just under ¾ cup). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and consistency. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dessert or a rich sauce, knowing the exact cup equivalent of 185 ml of heavy cream ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with heavy cream, even small measurement discrepancies can affect the outcome of your dish. Too much cream can make sauces overly rich or desserts too dense, while too little might leave them dry or lacking flavour. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical, as the cooking process is faster and more intense. A slight variation could mean the difference between a perfectly crispy dish and one that’s undercooked or soggy.</p>  
<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you’ll notice many dishes rely on exact measurements for optimal results. Heavy cream is often used in air fryer desserts like custards or creamy pasta sauces, where balance is key. Measuring 185 ml of heavy cream correctly ensures your dish maintains the intended texture and flavour.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 185 ml of Heavy Cream Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 185 ml of heavy cream accurately using standard measuring cups. Since 185 ml converts to roughly 0.78 cups, you can fill a measuring cup just under the ¾ cup mark. For even more precision, use a liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings. This method is especially useful when preparing air fryer recipes where consistency matters.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 185 ml of Heavy Cream</h2>

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Heavy Cream</h2>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cream Types</h3>  
<p>Not all creams are the same—double cream, whipping cream, and single cream have different fat contents. If a recipe specifies 185 ml of heavy cream, substituting it with a lighter cream may alter the texture. For air fryer recipes, heavy cream’s higher fat content often provides the best results, so stick to the recommended type whenever possible.</p>

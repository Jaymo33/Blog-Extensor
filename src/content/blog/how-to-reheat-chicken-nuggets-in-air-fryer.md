<p>To reheat chicken nuggets in an air fryer, set the temperature to 180°C (350°F) and cook for 3-5 minutes. This method restores crispiness better than microwaving while preventing the rubbery texture that plagues reheated fast food. Your air fryer circulates hot air to evenly crisp every nugget without needing extra oil.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer for Reheating Nuggets?</h2>
<p>The air fryer's rapid air technology makes it ideal for reheating chicken nuggets. Unlike microwaves that steam food, the air fryer recreates the original frying process. You'll find that leftover nuggets from McDonald's, KFC, or homemade batches regain their satisfying crunch.

<p>Another advantage is portion control. You can reheat exactly how many nuggets you want without wasting energy. The small cooking chamber heats up quickly, making it more efficient than conventional ovens for small batches. This method works perfectly with frozen nuggets too – just add 1-2 extra minutes to the cooking time.</p>

<h3>Optimal Temperature Settings</h3>
<p>180°C (350°F) is the sweet spot for reheating chicken nuggets in an air fryer. This temperature is hot enough to crisp the exterior without burning the coating. If your nuggets were refrigerated, let them sit at room temperature for 5 minutes before reheating to prevent cold spots. Some air fryer models have specific reheat functions – consult your manual if unsure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Reheating Instructions</h2>
<p>First, preheat your air fryer for 2 minutes at 180°C. Arrange the nuggets in a single layer with space between each piece – overcrowding causes uneven heating. For extra crispiness, lightly spritz with oil using a spray bottle. Cook for 3 minutes, then shake the basket and check for doneness.

<p>For frozen nuggets, extend the time to 5-6 minutes total. The coating should sound crisp when tapped. Serve immediately with your favourite dips – the texture is best when eaten straight from the air fryer. Leftover nuggets make fantastic additions to salads or wraps when reheated this way.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Common Mistakes</h3>
<p>The main pitfall when reheating chicken nuggets in an air fryer is overcooking. Set a timer and check frequently after the 3-minute mark. Never stack nuggets – the ones at the bottom will steam instead of crisp. If your air fryer tends to run hot, reduce the temperature by 10°C.

<h2>Special Considerations for Different Nugget Types</h2>
<p>Homemade chicken nuggets often have thicker coatings than commercial versions. These may need an extra minute at 170°C to heat through without burning. Gluten-free or baked varieties can dry out faster – spritz lightly with water before reheating. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes category</a> has more preparation tips.</p>
<p>For extra-large nuggets or chicken tenders, cut them in half before reheating to ensure even cooking. Spicy varieties may release oils during reheating – place parchment paper in the basket to prevent smoking. Always check internal temperature reaches 74°C if concerned about food safety.</p>

<h3>Serving Suggestions After Reheating</h3>
<p>Transform reheated nuggets into meals by pairing with air-fried chips or vegetables. They make excellent protein for lunchboxes when cooled after reheating. Try chopping them over pasta or pizza for added crunch. The versatility of properly reheated nuggets makes them a freezer staple worth keeping.</p>

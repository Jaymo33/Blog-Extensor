<p>223 C converts to approximately 200 C in a fan oven. This 20-degree reduction is standard for fan-assisted cooking, as the circulating air distributes heat more efficiently. Whether you're baking cakes or roasting vegetables, this conversion ensures even cooking without over-browning.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Temperature Conversions</h2>
<p>Fan ovens revolutionise home cooking by using a built-in fan to circulate hot air. This system cooks food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, which is why temperature adjustments are necessary. The general rule is to reduce temperatures by 20°C when converting from conventional to fan oven settings.</p>
<p>For 223 C in particular, dropping to 200 C in a fan oven prevents overcooking while maintaining perfect texture. This conversion works especially well for delicate bakes like soufflés or precise recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>. The same principle applies when using an air fryer, which essentially functions as a compact fan oven.</p>

<h2>How This Applies to Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Modern air fryers use the same rapid air technology as fan ovens, making them ideal for quick, energy-efficient cooking. When a recipe calls for 223 C, you'll typically set your air fryer to 200 C. This ensures crispy results without burning - perfect for frozen foods or homemade chips.</p>
<p>Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> shows how these temperatures compare across different cooking methods. For instance, 223 C in a conventional oven equals 200 C in both fan ovens and most air fryers. This consistency makes recipe adaptation straightforward for home cooks.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Baking</h3>
<p>When converting 223 C for baking cakes or bread, monitor doneness 5-10 minutes earlier than recipe timings suggest. The combination of lower temperature and efficient heat circulation can accelerate cooking. This is particularly important for delicate sponges or pastry recipes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Cakes>cake collection</a>.</p>

<h2>Common Cooking Applications</h2>
<p>The 223 C to 200 C conversion suits numerous dishes from roast chicken to vegetable bakes. For meats, this temperature creates perfect browning while keeping juices locked in. When preparing frozen foods like chips or nuggets, the adjusted temperature prevents sogginess without charring.</p>
<p>This conversion also works beautifully for sheet pan dinners and one-tray bakes. The even heat distribution means you can cook multiple components simultaneously - perhaps pairing salmon fillets with roast potatoes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Salmon>salmon recipes</a>. Just remember to rotate pans halfway for uniform results.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times</h3>
<p>While the temperature converts directly, cooking times may vary slightly. Fan ovens and air fryers typically cook 10-15% faster than conventional ovens at the same nominal temperature. When converting 223 C recipes, start checking for doneness about 5 minutes before the suggested time.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Your Equipment</h2>
<p>Regular cleaning ensures your fan oven or air fryer maintains accurate temperatures. For tough grease buildup, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning solutions</a>. This is especially important when working with precise temperatures like 223 C conversions, as residue can affect heat distribution.</p>
<p>Always preheat your fan oven or air fryer for about 5 minutes when cooking at 200 C (converted from 223 C). This stabilises the temperature for consistent results. For best performance, avoid overcrowding the cooking space - air circulation is key to successful fan-assisted cooking.</p>

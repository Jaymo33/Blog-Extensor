<p>1.33 cups of raisins equals approximately 6.5 ounces (or 6.5 oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of air-fried oatmeal raisin cookies or adding raisins to a savoury pilaf, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and ingredient proportions play a crucial role in achieving the perfect texture. Too many raisins can lead to uneven cooking, while too few might leave your dish lacking flavour. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer granola</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, precise measurements ensure balanced sweetness and crunch.</p>  

<p>Raisins are a popular addition to both sweet and savoury dishes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>morning oats</a> to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>stuffed chicken</a>. Their natural sugars caramelise beautifully in the air fryer, adding depth to your meals. By converting 1.33 cups of raisins to ounces, you can follow recipes with confidence, whether they’re from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or your grandma’s handwritten notes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Raisins Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a kitchen scale. Lightly packed raisins in a measuring cup will yield around 6.5 ounces for 1.33 cups. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the raisins before spooning them into the cup to avoid compacting, which can lead to over-measuring.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.33 Cups of Raisins in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for recipes serving 4–6 people. Try it in air-fried cinnamon rolls, where the raisins add a chewy contrast to the fluffy dough. Or mix them into a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>energy bites</a> for a quick, healthy snack. The slight tartness of raisins also pairs well with roasted vegetables or spiced rice dishes.</p>  

<p>If you’re meal prepping, 1.33 cups (6.5 oz) of raisins can be divided into smaller portions for overnight oats or trail mix. Their long shelf life makes them ideal for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a>, and their natural sweetness reduces the need for added sugars.

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Raisins</h2>  
<p>After measuring out 1.33 cups (6.5 oz), store unused raisins in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. They’ll stay fresh for months, ready for your next air fryer adventure. For sticky raisins, a quick rinse and pat dry can make them easier to handle.</p>

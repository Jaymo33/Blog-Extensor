<h2>Why Convert 50g of Mustard to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially older cookbooks or international guides. Converting 50g of mustard to ounces (1.76 oz) helps maintain accuracy in your cooking. This is particularly important for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can affect texture and flavour. Mustard is a common ingredient in marinades, like those for chicken or lamb, so getting the measurement right matters.

<p>If you're using an air fryer, even small discrepancies in measurements can impact cooking times and results. For example, too much mustard in a glaze could make it overly tangy or affect browning.

<h3>How to Measure 50g of Mustard Accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 50g of mustard. If you don't have one, tablespoons can work in a pinchâ€”roughly 3.5 tablespoons of mustard equal 50g. However, weights can vary slightly depending on the mustard's thickness. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key, so a scale is best.

<p>1.5 cups of plain flour equals approximately 188 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up air fryer cookies or a crispy coating for chicken, knowing the exact gram equivalent ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of flour is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too much flour can lead to dry, dense results, while too little may affect texture and structure. For example, if you’re making air fryer doughnuts or coating fish for a crispy finish, 1.5 cups of plain flour (188 grams) ensures the perfect balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like cakes or batters, rely on precise flour quantities. A slight deviation can alter cooking times and outcomes. That’s why weighing flour in grams—rather than relying solely on cups—is a game-changer for air fryer enthusiasts. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Plain Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.5 cups of plain flour accurately, fluff the flour with a spoon before lightly scooping it into a measuring cup. Avoid packing it down, as this can add extra grams unintentionally. For best results, use a kitchen scale to confirm 188 grams. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, where consistency is key.</p>  

<h2>Differences Between UK and US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>While 1.5 cups of plain flour generally translates to 188 grams, slight variations exist between UK and US cup sizes. In the UK, a cup holds 250ml, whereas the US uses 240ml. For air fryer cooking, sticking to weight (grams) eliminates confusion. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes both cup and gram measurements for foolproof results.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting a US recipe for your air fryer, double-check whether the author uses the US or UK cup standard. When in doubt, 188 grams of plain flour per 1.5 cups is a reliable benchmark.

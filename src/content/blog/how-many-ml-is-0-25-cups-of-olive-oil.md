At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accuracy is when converting cups to ml, especially for oils like olive oil, which can affect texture and flavour.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer ensures even cooking and prevents excess grease. Too little oil, and your food might dry out; too much, and it could become soggy.

<h3>Converting Cups to ml for Different Oils</h3>  
<p>While 0.25 cups of olive oil is 59 ml, other oils like sunflower or coconut may have slight density differences. However, for most cooking purposes, the conversion remains close enough. Always use a measuring jug for liquids to ensure precision, especially when preparing air fryer meals.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 0.25 Cups of Olive Oil Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a tablespoon to measure 0.25 cups of olive oil. Since 1 tablespoon is roughly 15 ml, four tablespoons will give you 60 ml—just slightly more than 59 ml. For most recipes, this small difference won’t matter, but for baking, precision is key.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is using a kitchen scale. Olive oil weighs about 0.92 grams per ml, so 59 ml would be approximately 54 grams. If you’re serious about perfecting your air fryer dishes, investing in a good scale is worthwhile.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Olive Oil</h3>

<p>350 grams of rolled oats equals approximately 3.5 cups, but this can vary slightly depending on how tightly packed the oats are. If you're using an air fryer for baking or meal prep, getting the measurement right ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're making granola, oatmeal cookies, or a hearty breakfast, accurate conversions are key.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of rolled oats ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Too much or too little can affect cooking times and texture. For example, if you're making granola, uneven measurements might lead to clumping or burning. The air fryer’s rapid air circulation means precision is even more important than in conventional baking.

<h3>How to Measure 350 Grams of Rolled Oats Correctly</h3>  
<p>The best way to measure rolled oats is by using a kitchen scale for accuracy. If you don’t have one, fluff the oats with a spoon before lightly scooping them into a measuring cup. Avoid packing them down, as this can lead to an incorrect measurement. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key, so always level off the top of the cup.

<p>1.33 cups of pumpkin seeds equals approximately 6.4 ounces (or 6.4 oz) when measured in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re roasting pumpkin seeds for a snack or using them in a dish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and the right amount of ingredients ensures everything cooks uniformly. Too many pumpkin seeds could overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven roasting. Too few might burn quickly. That’s why converting 1.33 cups of pumpkin seeds to ounces (6.4 oz) is so helpful.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision for perfect results.

Plus, it helps when scaling recipes up or down.</p>

<h2>How to measure pumpkin seeds for air frying</h2>
<p>Measuring pumpkin seeds by weight (ounces) is more accurate than using cups, as volume can vary. If you don’t have a kitchen scale, here’s a quick method: lightly fill a measuring cup with pumpkin seeds and level it off. For 1.33 cups, you’ll need roughly 6.4 ounces.</p>
<p>If you’re using an air fryer, spread the seeds in a single layer for even roasting. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. It’s a lifesaver for quick adjustments!</p>

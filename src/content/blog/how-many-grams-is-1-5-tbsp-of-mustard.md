Whether you’re whipping up a marinade or adding a tangy kick to your dish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on delivering accurate conversions to help you cook with confidence.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Mustard Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of mustard can significantly impact the flavour and texture of your air fryer dishes. Too little, and your recipe might lack depth; too much, and it could overpower other ingredients. For example, a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> relies on balanced flavours, and mustard plays a key role. Using grams instead of tablespoons eliminates guesswork, especially since mustard’s density can vary slightly between brands.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you’ll notice many provide both volume and weight measurements. This is because weight (grams) is far more reliable than volume (tablespoons) for consistent results. A digital kitchen scale is a worthwhile investment for any air fryer enthusiast, ensuring your mustard and other ingredients are measured perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>How to Convert 1.5 Tbsp of Mustard to Grams</h2>  
<p>Converting tablespoons to grams isn’t always straightforward, as it depends on the ingredient’s density. For mustard, 1 tablespoon typically equals about 14.7 grams, meaning 1.5 tbsp is roughly 22 grams. This conversion is based on standard UK mustard, but if you’re using a thicker or spicier variety, the weight might differ slightly. Always check your mustard’s label for nutritional info, as some brands list the weight per serving.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Precision</h3>  
<p>If you want absolute accuracy, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend. Simply place your measuring spoon on the scale, tare it to zero, then add mustard until you hit 22 grams. This method removes any uncertainty and ensures your air fryer recipes turn out as intended.

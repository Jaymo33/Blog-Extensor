<h3>Common Uses for 40g Golden Syrup in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Golden syrup adds a caramel-like sweetness to both sweet and savoury dishes. In the air fryer, 40g (1.41 oz) can glaze roasted carrots, sweeten granola clusters, or bind energy balls. Its high sugar content also helps create crispy textures, perfect for desserts like air-fried doughnuts or sticky gingerbread.</p>  

<h3>Storing Golden Syrup for Longevity</h3>  
<p>Keep your golden syrup in an airtight container at room temperature. Exposure to air can cause crystallization, making it harder to measure 40g accurately.

<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of condensed milk equals approximately 50 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your desserts or glazes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making air fryer cakes or sticky sauces, knowing the exact weight saves you from under or over-measuring. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver consistent results, especially with sticky ingredients like condensed milk. Too much can make desserts overly sweet or cause uneven cooking, while too little might leave dishes dry. Using grams instead of tablespoons eliminates guesswork, particularly when scaling recipes up or down. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<h3>How to measure condensed milk correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 2.5 tbsp of condensed milk to grams conversion, use a digital kitchen scale. Lightly grease your spoon to help the thick milk slide off easily, ensuring you don’t pack it down. If you’re adapting a recipe from cups or ounces, always cross-check with a reliable converter. Need inspiration? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> featuring condensed milk.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for condensed milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk adds richness to air fryer desserts like banoffee pie, tres leches cake, or caramel drizzles. It’s also great for glazing pastries or sweetening coffee-infused treats. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, precise measurements prevent burning or undercooking. For cleaning sticky residues, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Converting other condensed milk amounts</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 1 tbsp, that’s roughly 20g; 5 tbsp equals 100g. Bookmark these conversions for quick reference when experimenting with air fryer desserts. Remember, UK tablespoons differ slightly from US measurements, so always verify your tools.

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Caster sugar’s fine texture affects how it interacts with other ingredients, often creating lighter, more even bakes in the air fryer. Because it dissolves faster, it can lead to better aeration in cakes and a more consistent caramelisation in cookies compared to granulated sugar."

<p>0.66 cup of caster sugar equals approximately 5.28 ounces in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking cakes or desserts. Whether you're whipping up a quick batch of cookies or a delicate sponge, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than traditional ovens, which means precise measurements are crucial. Too much sugar can cause your baked goods to brown too quickly or even burn. Too little, and your desserts might lack sweetness or structure. That’s why converting 0.66 cup of caster sugar to ounces—5.28 oz—is so important for consistent results.</p>
<p>For more air fryer baking tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, where we share foolproof methods for perfect cakes and cookies. You’ll also find handy guides like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, which makes switching between cups, grams, and ounces a breeze.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.66 cup of caster sugar accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring 0.66 cup of caster sugar might seem tricky, but it’s simple with the right tools. Use a digital kitchen scale for the most precise results—simply tare your bowl and pour until you hit 5.28 ounces. If you don’t have scales, fill a measuring cup two-thirds full, then lightly level it off with a knife.</p>
<p>Remember, caster sugar is finer than granulated sugar, so it packs more densely. This means scooping it directly from the bag can lead to over-measuring. Instead, spoon the sugar gently into your cup for accuracy. For more measurement hacks, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, where precision is key.</p>

<h3>Common air fryer recipes using 0.66 cup caster sugar</h3>
<p>Many air fryer desserts call for around 0.66 cup (5.28 oz) of caster sugar. Classic vanilla cupcakes, for instance, often use this amount to achieve the perfect sweetness without overwhelming the batter. Similarly, shortbread biscuits and delicate sponges benefit from this measured quantity.</p>

<h2>Converting other sugar measurements for your air fryer</h2>
<p>While 0.66 cup of caster sugar equals 5.28 ounces, you might need other conversions for different recipes. For example, 1 cup of caster sugar is roughly 8 ounces, while half a cup is about 4 ounces. Keeping these figures in mind helps when adjusting portion sizes or trying new dishes.</p>
<p>If you’re working with brown sugar or icing sugar instead, remember their weights differ slightly due to texture and moisture content. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers all these variations, making it your go-to resource for air fryer baking success.</p>

<h3>Tips for storing caster sugar for air fryer use</h3>
<p>To keep your caster sugar fresh and ready for air fryer recipes, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Humidity can cause clumping, which makes measuring 0.66 cup (5.28 oz) accurately more challenging. If your sugar does harden, a quick blitz in the food processor restores its fine texture.</p>

<p>1.0 cups of rice equals approximately 200 grams, though this can vary slightly depending on the type of rice. Whether you're using a UK or US cup measurement, this conversion ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Precise measurements are key for consistent results, especially when cooking rice-based dishes like fried rice or rice cakes in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Rice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Cooking rice in an air fryer requires precision to avoid undercooking or drying it out. Using 1.0 cups of rice (around 200 grams) ensures the right texture and consistency. If you're meal prepping or following a specific recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing the exact gram equivalent helps replicate perfect results every time.</p>  

<p>Different rice types, like basmati or jasmine, have slight weight variations, but 200 grams per 1.0 cups is a reliable baseline. For air fryer dishes like crispy rice cakes or stuffed peppers, this measurement ensures even cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1.0 UK cups of rice weigh roughly 200 grams, US cups may differ slightly due to volume variations. Always double-check your recipe’s origin to ensure accuracy. For air fryer cooking, sticking to grams eliminates confusion and guarantees consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Converting 1.0 Cups of Rice for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use grams for precision. If a recipe calls for 1.0 cups of rice, you can confidently substitute 200 grams. This is especially useful for dishes like air-fried rice balls or stuffed vegetables, where exact proportions matter.</p>  

<p>For baking or crispy rice snacks, measuring by weight ensures even cooking and texture. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> to put your perfectly measured rice to delicious use.</p>  

<h3>Common Rice Types and Their Weights</h3>  
<p>Long-grain rice like basmati may weigh slightly less (about 190 grams per 1.0 cups), while short-grain varieties like sushi rice can be closer to 210 grams. Adjust your air fryer cooking times accordingly for the best results.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Cooking Rice in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Pre-rinsing rice removes excess starch, preventing clumping in the air fryer. For 1.0 cups (200 grams) of rice, use a 1:1.5 rice-to-water ratio for fluffy results. Pair it with proteins or veggies from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for a complete meal.</p>  

<p>Always preheat your air fryer and stir rice halfway through cooking for even heat distribution. For crispy rice dishes, lightly spray with oil before air frying. Need cleaning tips?

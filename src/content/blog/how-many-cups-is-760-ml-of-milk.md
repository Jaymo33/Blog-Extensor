Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Too much or too little liquid can affect texture, cooking time, and even flavour.

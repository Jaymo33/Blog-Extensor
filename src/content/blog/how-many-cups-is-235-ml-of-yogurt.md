<p>235 ml of yogurt equals approximately 1 cup (0.99 cups to be precise). This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up a cake or marinating chicken for the air fryer, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Yogurt Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt can make or break a recipe. Too much can make baked goods dense, while too little might leave sauces too thin. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, getting the yogurt quantity right is key.</p>  

<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient, often used in marinades, dressings, and baking. Whether you're making a creamy dip or a fluffy cake, 235 ml of yogurt translates to just under 1 cup. This small difference might not seem like much, but in baking, even slight variations can affect the outcome.</p>  

<h2>Converting 235 ml of Yogurt to Cups</h2>  
<p>To convert 235 ml of yogurt to cups, you’ll need to know that 1 US cup equals 240 ml. This means 235 ml is roughly 0.99 cups, or essentially 1 cup for most practical purposes. If you're using a UK cup measurement, note that 1 UK cup is 284 ml, making 235 ml closer to 0.83 cups.</p>  

<p>For air fryer cooking, especially when following recipes like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, sticking to US cup measurements is often easier. Most modern recipes, including those for air fryers, use the US standard. If you're unsure, a kitchen scale can help verify your measurements.</p>  

<h3>Tools for Measuring Yogurt</h3>  
<p>A liquid measuring cup is the best tool for measuring yogurt, as it allows you to see the exact millilitre or cup measurement. For thicker yogurts, like Greek yogurt, spooning it into the cup and levelling it off ensures accuracy. If you're prepping a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, precise measurements help balance flavours perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 235 ml of Yogurt</h2>  
<p>235 ml of yogurt is a common measurement in many recipes. It’s often used in cakes, muffins, and marinades. For air fryer cooking, yogurt can tenderise meats or add creaminess to sauces. If you're making a yogurt-based dip for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetables</a>, this quantity is ideal.</p>  

<p>Yogurt also works well in breakfast recipes, like pancakes or smoothies. If you're meal prepping with your air fryer, knowing how much yogurt to use ensures consistency. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for tips on keeping your appliance clean after cooking with yogurt-based recipes.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Yogurt Types</h3>  
<p>Greek yogurt is thicker than regular yogurt, so 235 ml will weigh more. If a recipe calls for regular yogurt and you're using Greek, you might need to thin it slightly with milk or water. For air fryer recipes, this adjustment ensures marinades coat evenly and don’t clump.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and even small measurement errors can affect your dish. Too little, and your cake won’t rise; too much, and it might taste bitter. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precision is key. If you’re experimenting with recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing how to convert 500g of baking powder to ounces ensures consistency. This is especially useful if you’re adapting American recipes, which often use ounces instead of grams.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer grams, but some older recipes or international guides might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 500g of baking powder to ounces (17.64 oz) helps bridge this gap.

<h3>How to Measure 500g of Baking Powder Without Scales</h3>

However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so we recommend using scales for accuracy.

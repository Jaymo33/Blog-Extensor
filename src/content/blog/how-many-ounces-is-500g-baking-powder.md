For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and even small measurement errors can affect your dish. Too little, and your cake won’t rise; too much, and it might taste bitter. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precision is key. If you’re experimenting with recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing how to convert 500g of baking powder to ounces ensures consistency. This is especially useful if you’re adapting American recipes, which often use ounces instead of grams.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer grams, but some older recipes or international guides might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 500g of baking powder to ounces (17.64 oz) helps bridge this gap. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 500g of Baking Powder Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can still measure 500g of baking powder using volume. One tablespoon of baking powder weighs roughly 10g, so 500g would be about 50 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so we recommend using scales for accuracy. For more measurement hacks, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 500g of Baking Powder in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Baking powder isn’t just for cakes—it’s also great for air-fried doughnuts, muffins, and even crispy batters. A 500g batch is ideal if you’re meal prepping or baking in bulk. Stored correctly in an airtight container, baking powder lasts up to a year. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>When converting 500g of baking powder to ounces, remember that 17.64 oz is the standard conversion. This ensures your air fryer bakes turn out light and fluffy every time.

<p>25g of coconut oil equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making crispy roasted vegetables or a delicious cake, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you get the measurements spot-on for flawless cooking every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil in your air fryer can affect texture, crispiness, and even cooking times. Too little oil, and your food might turn out dry; too much, and it could become greasy. For recipes like air-fried sweet potatoes or coconut shrimp, 25g of coconut oil (0.88 oz) is often the perfect amount. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Coconut oil is a popular choice for air frying because of its high smoke point and subtle flavour. Whether you’re cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or baking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, getting the measurement right ensures your dish turns out perfectly. If you’re unsure, a kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy, especially when dealing with small quantities like 25g.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of coconut oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 25g of coconut oil using tablespoons. One tablespoon of coconut oil weighs roughly 14g, so 25g is just under two tablespoons. Melted coconut oil can also be measured by volume—25g is about 1.75 tablespoons. For more precision, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, where we break down measurements for every dish.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of coconut oil in air frying</h2>  
<p>25g of coconut oil is ideal for coating vegetables, marinating proteins, or greasing air fryer baskets. For example, tossing Brussels sprouts in 25g of melted coconut oil before air frying ensures even crispiness. It’s also perfect for making air-fried <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or cookies, where precise fat measurements affect texture.</p>  

<p>Another great use is for reheating leftovers. A light brush of 25g coconut oil on pizza or bread keeps it from drying out in the air fryer. If you’re cleaning your air fryer afterward, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has tips to remove oil residue easily.</p>  

<h3>Converting other coconut oil amounts</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less coconut oil, here’s a quick reference: 50g is about 1.76 oz, and 100g is roughly 3.53 oz. For larger batches, like air-frying <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods</a>, scaling up the oil proportionally ensures even cooking. Always measure melted coconut oil for the most accurate results.</p>

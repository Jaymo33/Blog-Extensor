<p>985 ml of honey equals approximately 4.15 cups in the US measurement system and 3.46 cups in the UK system. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a glaze for your air fryer chicken, accurate measurements are key. Honey's thick consistency makes it tricky to measure, but this guide simplifies the process for you.</p>

<h2>Understanding Honey Measurements</h2>
<p>Honey is denser than water, so its volume-to-weight ratio differs. While 985 ml of water would be easier to measure, honey requires a bit more precision.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using too much or too little honey can throw off the balance of your dish. In baking, excess honey can make desserts overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them dry. For air fryer cooking, precise measurements ensure even coating and caramelisation.

<p>Honey's viscosity means it doesn't pour like water, so levelling off your measuring cup is essential. For sticky ingredients like honey, lightly greasing your measuring cup can help it slide out more easily. This trick is especially useful when preparing marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>.</p>

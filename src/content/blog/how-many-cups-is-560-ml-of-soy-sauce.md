Whether you’re cooking a stir-fry or marinating chicken, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups saves time and guarantees consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we simplify conversions so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as even small measurement errors can affect texture and flavour. Soy sauce, with its strong umami taste, requires careful balancing to avoid overpowering dishes. Converting 560 ml of soy sauce to cups ensures your marinades and sauces are perfectly seasoned.

<p>Air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, so precise liquid measurements prevent sogginess or dryness. Whether you’re making teriyaki salmon or glazed tofu, 560 ml of soy sauce (2.37 cups) delivers the right intensity. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using soy sauce in air-fried dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 560 ml of Soy Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a standard metric jug and fill it to the 560 ml mark. Alternatively, 560 ml is roughly 19 fluid ounces, which can help with imperial measurements. For sticky liquids like soy sauce, lightly grease the measuring tool to ensure easy pouring and accurate results.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 560 ml of Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for soy sauce as a base for marinades or dipping sauces. For example, 560 ml (2.37 cups) is ideal for batch-cooking teriyaki chicken or beef stir-fry. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for marinade ideas that use this quantity.</p>  

<p>Soy sauce also enhances vegetarian dishes, such as air-fried tofu or mushroom stir-fries. A 560 ml batch can be divided for multiple meals, saving prep time. For cleaning tips after cooking sticky sauces, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>Note that UK and US cup sizes differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. For 560 ml of soy sauce, this translates to 1.97 UK cups or 2.37 US cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid measurement discrepancies.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>After measuring 560 ml, store unused soy sauce in an airtight container in the fridge. It keeps for months but may darken over time—this doesn’t affect flavour. For more storage hacks, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep guides</a>.</p>  

<p>Consider freezing soy sauce in ice cube trays for portioned use in future air fryer recipes. Each cube holds about 15 ml, making it easy to thaw small amounts. This trick works well for recipes requiring 560 ml divided across multiple servings.</p>

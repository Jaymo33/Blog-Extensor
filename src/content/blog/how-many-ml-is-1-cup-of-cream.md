<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of cream in your air fryer recipes can make all the difference. Too much or too little can affect moisture levels, browning, and even cooking times.

That’s why converting 1.0 cups of cream to ml (237 ml) is a handy skill for any air fryer enthusiast.</p>

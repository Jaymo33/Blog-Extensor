<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of tomato paste equals approximately 23 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much tomato paste can make dishes overly thick or intense, while too little might leave them lacking depth. By converting 1.5 tbsp of tomato paste to grams, you ensure your recipes turn out just right. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so small measurement differences can have a big impact. Using grams instead of tablespoons removes guesswork, especially when scaling recipes up or down. This is particularly useful for air fryer cooking, where even distribution of ingredients is key.</p>

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of tomato paste</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 1.5 tbsp of tomato paste accurately. Use a standard tablespoon and level it off with a knife for precision. For sticky ingredients like tomato paste, lightly oiling the spoon can help it slide off easily. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for ideas.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>This small but mighty amount of tomato paste works wonders in air fryer dishes. It’s perfect for adding depth to marinades, glazes, or even as a base for homemade ketchup. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> benefit from this concentrated tomato flavour.</p>

<p>You might use 1.5 tbsp of tomato paste in a rub for air-fried wings or mix it into a sauce for meatballs. It’s also great for adding umami to vegetable dishes like roasted peppers or aubergines. The possibilities are endless with this versatile ingredient.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste</h3>
<p>After measuring out your 1.5 tbsp of tomato paste, you’ll likely have some left over. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze tablespoon-sized portions in ice cube trays – perfect for future air fryer creations.</p>

<h2>Converting other tomato paste measurements</h2>

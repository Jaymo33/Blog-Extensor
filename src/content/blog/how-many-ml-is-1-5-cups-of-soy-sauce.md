<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1.5 cups of soy sauce is universally 355 ml, cup sizes can vary slightly by region. US cups are 240 ml each, whereas UK cups are 284 ml. For soy sauce, this difference is negligible, but it’s worth noting for dry ingredients. Always use a liquid measuring jug for accuracy in air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Soy Sauce for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Liquid measurements are best done at eye level for precision. Pour soy sauce into a clear measuring jug until it reaches the 355 ml mark for 1.5 cups. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to spills or inaccuracies. For sticky sauces like soy, a silicone spatula helps scrape every last drop.

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 1.5 cups (355 ml) of soy sauce serves roughly 4–6 portions. For smaller batches, halve the amount to 177.5 ml. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often use this measurement for marinades.</p>  

<h3>Soy Sauce Substitutes in Air Frying</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of soy sauce, try tamari or coconut aminos, using the same 355 ml measurement for 1.5 cups. These alternatives work well in air fryer dishes, offering similar savoury notes. Just adjust salt levels accordingly, as some substitutes are less salty.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 1.5 Cups of Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer favourites, like teriyaki chicken or glazed salmon, call for 1.5 cups (355 ml) of soy sauce. This quantity is ideal for batch cooking or meal prep.

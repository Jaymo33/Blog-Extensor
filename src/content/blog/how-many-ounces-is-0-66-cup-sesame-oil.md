<p>0.66 cup of sesame oil equals approximately 5.28 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you’re making crispy tofu or marinating chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Sesame oil, with its rich, nutty flavour, is often used in Asian-inspired dishes like stir-fries or glazes. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may leave it dry. That’s why converting 0.66 cup of sesame oil to ounces (5.28 oz) helps maintain balance.</p>  
<p>For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. It covers everything from cups to grams, making recipe adjustments a breeze. If you’re experimenting with new dishes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sesame Oil Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for sesame oil, filling it just below the ⅔ cup mark (0.66 cup). For ounces, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply pour until it hits 5.28 oz. If you’re doubling a recipe, remember 1.32 cups would be 10.56 oz. Precision is key, especially for marinades or dressings.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Sesame Oil in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Sesame oil adds depth to dishes like air-fried shrimp, tofu, or vegetables. A little goes a long way—just 0.66 cup (5.28 oz) can coat several servings. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> for a crispy, flavourful finish.</p>

<h2>How to measure 4 tbsp of cottage cheese</h2>  
<p>To measure 4 tablespoons of cottage cheese, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml per tbsp). Scoop the cheese lightly without packing it down to avoid over-measuring. If you’re using a kitchen scale, tare it with your bowl before adding the cottage cheese until it reaches 60 grams. This method works for both full-fat and low-fat varieties.</p>  
<p>For recipes like air fryer stuffed mushrooms or cheesy potato cakes, precise measurements ensure even cooking. Cottage cheese melts differently depending on moisture content, so weighing it helps avoid soggy results. Need more air fryer hacks?

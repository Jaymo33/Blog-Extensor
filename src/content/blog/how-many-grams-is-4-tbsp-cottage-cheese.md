<h2>Why measuring cottage cheese matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial for air fryer cooking, especially with ingredients like cottage cheese, which can vary in density. Using grams instead of tablespoons ensures your recipes are consistent, whether you're making a breakfast bake or a savoury dish. Cottage cheese adds creaminess and protein to meals, so getting the right amount enhances both texture and flavour. If you're new to air fryer cooking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  
<p>Many UK recipes list cottage cheese in grams, so converting tablespoons to grams simplifies the process. This is particularly useful for meal prepping or scaling recipes up or down. Plus, weighing ingredients reduces cleanup since you won’t need multiple measuring spoons.

<h2>How to measure 4 tbsp of cottage cheese</h2>  
<p>To measure 4 tablespoons of cottage cheese, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml per tbsp). Scoop the cheese lightly without packing it down to avoid over-measuring. If you’re using a kitchen scale, tare it with your bowl before adding the cottage cheese until it reaches 60 grams. This method works for both full-fat and low-fat varieties.</p>  
<p>For recipes like air fryer stuffed mushrooms or cheesy potato cakes, precise measurements ensure even cooking. Cottage cheese melts differently depending on moisture content, so weighing it helps avoid soggy results. Need more air fryer hacks?

<h3>Common uses for 4 tbsp of cottage cheese</h3>  
<p>Four tablespoons of cottage cheese (60g) is perfect for single-serving air fryer dishes. Try mixing it into scrambled eggs, spreading it on toast before air frying, or blending it into dips. It’s also a great binder for veggie patties or meatballs, keeping them moist without excess oil.

<h3>Tips for storing cottage cheese</h3>  
<p>To keep cottage cheese fresh, always seal the container tightly and store it in the fridge. Use it within 3-4 days of opening for the best texture. If your recipe calls for 4 tbsp but you have leftovers, freeze portions in airtight bags for future air fryer meals. Thaw in the fridge before using to maintain consistency.</p>

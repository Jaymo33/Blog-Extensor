<p>100 grams of vegetable oil equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up crispy chips or a succulent roast, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you master these conversions effortlessly.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may leave it dry. Converting 100g of vegetable oil to ounces (3.53 oz) helps you stick to the recipe. For more tips on air fryer measurements, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some cooks prefer ounces for convenience. Knowing that 100g vegetable oil equals 3.53 ounces simplifies the process. This is especially useful when adapting recipes from international sources or scaling portions up or down. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for dishes that put these conversions to delicious use.</p>  

<h3>How to measure vegetable oil for air frying</h3>  
<p>Use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the oil until it reaches 100g (or 3.53 oz). If you don’t have a scale, a liquid measuring cup marked in ounces will work, though it’s less precise.

<h2>Common uses for 100g of vegetable oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>100g (3.53 oz) of vegetable oil is often used for coating ingredients like potatoes or chicken before air frying. This amount ensures even crispiness without excess grease. It’s also ideal for marinades or dressings in dishes like air-fried veggies. Find inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Some air fryer liners or accessories may require light oiling to prevent sticking. A 100g portion is enough for multiple batches, keeping cleanup easy.

<h3>Converting other oil quantities</h3>

At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions simple so your cooking stays stress-free.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of milk is crucial for achieving the right texture and flavour in your dishes. Too much or too little can affect everything from batter consistency to sauce thickness. For air fryer recipes, where ingredients cook quickly, precision is even more important. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, knowing how many cups 960 ml of milk equals ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<p>Milk is a common ingredient in both baking and cooking, so understanding conversions helps streamline your kitchen prep. Whether you're making pancakes, custards, or even a creamy pasta bake in your air fryer, accurate measurements prevent mishaps. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 960 ml of milk converts to roughly 4.06 cups in both the UK and US, slight variations can exist due to rounding. For most recipes, this difference won’t be noticeable, but it’s good practice to use a measuring jug for liquids. If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>our dessert section</a>, precision ensures your treats turn out just right.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 960 ml of Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can still measure 960 ml of milk using standard cups. A UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 960 ml is just under 4 full cups. For US cups, which are slightly smaller at 240 ml, you’d need about 4 cups plus an extra tablespoon. This method works well for most recipes, including those in your air fryer.</p>  

<p>For best results, pour the milk slowly to avoid spills and check the measurement at eye level. If you're preparing a dish from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>our breakfast recipes</a>, accurate milk measurements ensure fluffy pancakes or perfectly set custards. Keeping a conversion guide handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, makes cooking easier.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 960 ml of Milk</h3>  
<p>Many recipes call for 960 ml of milk, especially larger batches of baked goods or creamy sauces. A classic béchamel sauce, for example, often uses this amount for a rich, smooth texture. In the air fryer, you might use 960 ml of milk for a big batch of French toast casserole or a creamy pasta bake.</p>

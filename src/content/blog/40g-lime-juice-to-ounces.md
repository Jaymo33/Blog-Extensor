<p>40 grams of lime juice equals approximately 1.41 ounces. Whether you're whipping up a tangy marinade or a zesty glaze for your air fryer dishes, getting the measurement right ensures balanced flavours. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, especially when working with citrus in recipes like air-fried fish or vibrant vegetable dishes.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate lime juice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Lime juice can make or break a dish—too little and the flavour falls flat, too much and it overpowers. For air fryer recipes, where ingredients cook quickly and intensely, balanced acidity is key. A dish like air-fried shrimp or citrus-glazed chicken relies on the perfect 40g lime juice to ounces ratio. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> takes the guesswork out of scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<p>British cooks often work in grams, but many older recipes or international guides use ounces. Knowing that 40g lime juice equals 1.41 oz helps adapt recipes seamlessly. This is especially handy for marinades, where lime juice tenderises proteins like chicken or tofu before they hit the air fryer basket.</p>  

<h3>Tools for measuring lime juice</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 40g of lime juice. If using volume, note that fresh lime juice weighs roughly 1.04g per ml—meaning 40g is about 38.5ml. For ounce conversions, a liquid measuring cup with both metric and imperial markings avoids confusion. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a> for dishes using precise citrus measurements.</p>  

<h2>Converting 40g lime juice in UK recipes</h2>  
<p>In the UK, grams are standard, but ounce conversions pop up in global air fryer communities or vintage cookbooks. Whether you're making zesty air-fried cod or a lime-dressed salad, remember: 40g lime juice to ounces is 1.41 oz. This conversion works for both freshly squeezed and bottled juice, though fresh always packs more flavour.</p>  

<p>For context, one medium lime yields about 30-45g of juice—so 40g is roughly one generous lime's worth. When a recipe calls for "the juice of one lime," weighing ensures consistency. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> features multiple dishes where this conversion proves useful, from sticky wings to citrus-infused thighs.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes with 40g lime juice</h3>  
<p>If scaling a recipe up or down, maintain the 40g lime juice to oz ratio for balanced acidity. For example, doubling a marinade? 80g lime juice converts to 2.82 oz. This precision ensures dressings emulsify properly and proteins marinate evenly before air frying. Always taste and adjust—limes vary in tartness depending on ripeness and origin.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 40g lime juice in air frying</h2>  
<p>From seafood to desserts, 40g lime juice (1.41 oz) adds brightness to air fryer creations. Try it in a Vietnamese-inspired glaze for air-fried shrimp, or mix with honey for sticky chicken wings. Even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> benefit—lime juice balances the sweetness of air-fried pineapple or mango.</p>  

<p>Citrus also prevents browning in air-fried vegetables like courgettes or green beans. A quick toss with 40g lime juice pre-cooking keeps colours vibrant. For cleaning your air fryer post-cooking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>maintenance guide</a> recommends using lemon or lime juice to dissolve grease—another reason to master these conversions!</p>

<p>0.5 cup of cooked rice weighs approximately 4 ounces (113 grams). This measurement is essential for portioning meals, especially when using an air fryer for reheating or cooking rice-based dishes. Whether you're meal prepping or following a recipe, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy and consistency in your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as uneven portions can lead to inconsistent cooking. A 0.5 cup of cooked rice equals 4 ounces, making it easier to divide meals or adjust recipes. For example, if you're reheating rice in the air fryer, knowing the weight helps you set the correct time and temperature. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for specific amounts of rice, especially in dishes like fried rice or stuffed peppers. Measuring 0.5 cup of cooked rice in ounces ensures you get the perfect texture and don’t overcrowd the basket. Overloading can lead to uneven heating, while too little might dry out the rice. For more recipe ideas, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cup of Cooked Rice</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup to scoop the rice, then level it off with a knife for accuracy. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 0.5 cup of cooked rice is roughly 4 ounces. For sticky rice, lightly fluff it before measuring to avoid compacting too much into the cup. This method ensures you get the right portion every time.</p>  

<h2>Converting 0.5 Cup of Cooked Rice to Ounces for Different Rice Types</h2>  
<p>While 0.5 cup of cooked white rice typically weighs 4 ounces, brown rice may be slightly heavier due to its density. Basmati or jasmine rice might weigh less, around 3.5 ounces per 0.5 cup, as the grains are fluffier. Always adjust air fryer settings accordingly based on the type of rice you’re using.</p>  

<p>For meal prepping, knowing these conversions helps with portion control. If you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a>, weighing your rice ensures each serving is consistent. This is especially useful for tracking calories or macros. A kitchen scale is a handy tool, but if you don’t have one, the 0.5 cup to 4-ounce rule is a reliable guide.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Cooked Rice</h3>  
<p>Packing rice too tightly into the cup can lead to inaccurate measurements. Always spoon the rice lightly into the measuring cup for the most precise results. Another mistake is using a liquid measuring cup, which can distort the amount due to its shape. Stick to dry measuring cups or a scale for best accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Using 0.5 Cup of Cooked Rice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>From crispy rice cakes to stuffed vegetables, 0.5 cup of cooked rice (4 ounces) is a versatile ingredient. Try adding it to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based dishes</a> for extra texture. The air fryer’s even heat distribution ensures the rice reheats perfectly without drying out. Just spread it evenly in the basket for the best results.</p>

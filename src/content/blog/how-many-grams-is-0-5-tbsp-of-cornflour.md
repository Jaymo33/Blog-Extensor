<p>0.5 tbsp of cornflour equals approximately 4 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking or thickening sauces. Getting the measurement right ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best results. Too much or too little cornflour can affect texture and consistency. For example, using the correct 0.5 tbsp of cornflour (4 grams) ensures crispy coatings or perfectly thickened sauces. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially baked goods or batters, depend on exact measurements. Cornflour is often used as a thickener or to create light, crispy textures. Whether you're making fried chicken or a delicate cake, knowing how many grams are in 0.5 tbsp of cornflour makes all the difference.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of cornflour accurately</h2>
<p>The easiest way to measure 0.5 tbsp of cornflour is to use a digital kitchen scale. Simply scoop the cornflour into a tablespoon measure, then level it off for accuracy. If you don't have scales, lightly fill half a tablespoon without packing it down.</p>
<p>For those who prefer volume measurements, remember that 1 UK tablespoon equals 15ml. Therefore, 0.5 tbsp is 7.5ml of cornflour. However, weight measurements (grams) are more reliable for consistent results in your air fryer cooking. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration using precise measurements.</p>

<h3>Cornflour vs other thickeners in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>Cornflour has unique properties that make it ideal for air fryer cooking. It creates crispier coatings than plain flour and thickens sauces without cloudiness. When a recipe calls for 0.5 tbsp of cornflour (4 grams), it's specifically designed to work with these properties.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp of cornflour in air frying</h2>
<p>This small measurement of cornflour has big uses in air fryer cooking. It's perfect for dusting chicken wings before air frying to achieve extra crispiness. The 4 grams (0.5 tbsp) measurement is often used in small-batch recipes or when making adjustments to existing recipes.</p>
<p>Another popular use is in gluten-free air fryer baking, where cornflour helps create light textures. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> include small amounts of cornflour for this purpose. Remember to keep your air fryer clean after using powdery ingredients - our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> can help.</p>

<h3>Converting other cornflour measurements</h3>
<p>If you need to scale up from 0.5 tbsp of cornflour, remember these conversions: 1 tbsp equals about 8 grams, and 1 teaspoon equals roughly 2.7 grams. These measurements are particularly useful when adapting conventional oven recipes for your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Tips for working with cornflour in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Always sift cornflour before measuring to prevent lumps, especially when using small amounts like 0.5 tbsp (4 grams). This ensures even distribution in batters or coatings. Store cornflour in an airtight container to maintain its quality between uses.</p>
<p>When substituting cornflour in recipes, remember that it has about twice the thickening power of plain flour. So if a recipe calls for 1 tbsp plain flour, you'd only need 0.5 tbsp (4 grams) of cornflour instead.

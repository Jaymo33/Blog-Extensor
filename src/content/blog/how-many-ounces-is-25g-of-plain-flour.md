<p>25g of plain flour equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up cakes, coating chicken, or making crispy tempura, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail these conversions effortlessly.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of flour is crucial in air fryer recipes. Too much can make coatings soggy, while too little might leave food undercrisped. For example, if you’re making air fryer chicken tenders, 25g of plain flour (0.88 oz) is often the perfect amount for a light, crispy coating. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> rely on precise measurements to deliver consistent results.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so batter and coatings need to be balanced. A slight miscalculation in flour weight can affect texture and cooking time. That’s why we recommend using digital scales for accuracy, especially when working with small quantities like 25g. For more tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of plain flour without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can use a measuring spoon or cup. One tablespoon of plain flour weighs roughly 8g, so 25g is just over 3 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so for best results, invest in a cheap digital scale. They’re a game-changer for air fryer cooking, especially when baking cakes or bread.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 25g of plain flour</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of flour, like 25g. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> often use this quantity for a light dredge. Similarly, tempura vegetables or fish might need 25g of plain flour mixed with cornflour for extra crispiness. Even desserts like air fryer doughnuts sometimes require precise flour measurements for the perfect texture.</p>  

<p>If you’re making a batter for onion rings or zucchini fritters, 25g of plain flour is a great starting point. Combine it with spices and a liquid like milk or beer for a thin, crispy coating. Remember, air fryers cook faster than ovens, so coatings need to be light to avoid sogginess.

<h3>Converting other flour quantities for air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 50g, 100g, or another amount, the same conversion principle applies. For example, 50g of plain flour is about 1.76 ounces, and 100g is roughly 3.53 ounces. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy for quick reference. Whether you’re scaling up or down, accurate measurements ensure your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

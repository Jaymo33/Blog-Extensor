<p>125g of maple syrup is approximately 4.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when glazing meats or baking desserts. Whether you’re using a digital scale or measuring cups, knowing the exact weight ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the correct amount of maple syrup—whether 125g or its ounce equivalent—ensures your marinades, glazes, or baked goods have the right consistency. Too much syrup can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them lacking flavour.</p>  
<p>For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer glazed salmon</a>, 125g of maple syrup (4.41 oz) balances sweetness without overpowering the fish. Similarly, in desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, precise measurements prevent soggy or dry outcomes. Always double-check conversions to avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 125g of maple syrup without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use volume measurements. Since maple syrup is dense, 125g equals roughly 6 tablespoons or 90 millilitres. However, weight measurements are more accurate, so investing in a scale is worthwhile for frequent bakers.

Try it in sticky <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a> or as a sweetener for roasted vegetables like carrots or sweet potatoes.</p>  
<p>Another great use is in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, such as syrup-drizzled apple chips or pecan pies.

<h3>Tips for storing maple syrup</h3>

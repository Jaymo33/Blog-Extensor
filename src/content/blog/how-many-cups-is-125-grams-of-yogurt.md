<p>125 grams of yogurt is approximately 0.5 cups (½ cup) in standard US and UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise ingredient quantities ensure perfect results. Whether you’re whipping up a cake, marinade, or dip, knowing how to convert grams to cups makes cooking effortless.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Yogurt Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt in air fryer recipes ensures texture and moisture balance. Too much yogurt can make batters runny, while too little may dry out dishes like cakes or marinades. For example, our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">air fryer yogurt cake</a> relies on precise measurements for a fluffy, moist result. Always measure yogurt correctly to avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<p>Different yogurt types (Greek, natural, or flavored) have slight density variations, but 125 grams generally equals ½ cup. If you’re using thicker Greek yogurt, fluff it lightly with a spoon before measuring.

<h3>Converting 125 Grams of Yogurt to Cups</h3>

Level it off with a knife for a precise ½ cup. This method works for most recipes, from <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert">desserts</a> to savory dishes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 125 Grams of Yogurt in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

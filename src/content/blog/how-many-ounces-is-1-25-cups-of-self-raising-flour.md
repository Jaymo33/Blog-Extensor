<p>1.25 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 5.3 ounces (150 grams). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break your recipe.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of self-raising flour is crucial for baking success. Too much flour can make your cakes or breads dense, while too little can leave them flat. In an air fryer, where cooking times and temperatures are precise, correct measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're making air fryer scones or a quick cake, knowing how many ounces are in 1.25 cups of self-raising flour keeps your recipes consistent.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Self-Raising Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.25 cups of self-raising flour accurately, spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the flour, leading to an incorrect weight. For best results, use a kitchen scale to confirm 5.3 ounces (150 grams) for 1.25 cups.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Ounces for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

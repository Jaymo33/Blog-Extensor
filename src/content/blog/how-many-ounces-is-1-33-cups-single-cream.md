<p>1.33 cups of single cream equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you’re making a creamy pasta sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing the exact weight helps avoid mishaps. Single cream, a staple in British cooking, is lighter than double cream but still rich enough for many dishes. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and precise measurements ensure consistent results. Too much or too little single cream can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, a creamy mushroom sauce needs the right balance to avoid being too runny or thick. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for single cream, so getting the ounces right is crucial. Even small deviations can affect the final outcome, especially in baking.</p>

<p>Single cream has a fat content of around 18%, making it lighter than double cream but richer than milk. This makes it ideal for air fryer dishes where you want creaminess without heaviness. Whether you’re making a custard or a creamy soup, 1.33 cups (10.64 ounces) is a common measurement. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>

<h2>How to measure single cream accurately</h2>
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure single cream in ounces. If you don’t have one, a liquid measuring cup will do, but be mindful of meniscus lines. Pour the cream slowly to avoid spills and ensure the measurement is level. For 1.33 cups, you’ll need just over 10.5 ounces, which is roughly 300 millilitres. Always check the conversion if you’re using a recipe from a different country.</p>

<h3>Converting cups to ounces for other ingredients</h3>
<p>Not all ingredients weigh the same per cup, so conversions vary. For example, 1.33 cups of flour won’t weigh the same as single cream. This is why a conversion chart or scale is handy. If you’re adapting a recipe for your air fryer, precise measurements are key. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers common ingredients to simplify your cooking.</p>

<h2>Common uses for single cream in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Single cream is versatile and works well in both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes. From creamy pasta bakes to indulgent desserts like crème brûlée, it’s a kitchen staple. If you’re making a sauce, 1.33 cups (10.64 ounces) is often the perfect amount for four servings. For a lighter option, you can mix single cream with milk, but adjust the measurements accordingly. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for creamy dishes that use single cream.</p>

<h3>Storing single cream for air fryer cooking</h3>
<p>Single cream should be refrigerated and used within a few days of opening. If you’ve measured out 1.33 cups but don’t need it all, store the rest in an airtight container. Avoid freezing single cream as it can separate when thawed.

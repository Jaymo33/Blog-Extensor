<p>3 tablespoons of tomato paste equals approximately 45 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of tomato paste can significantly impact the taste and texture of your air fryer meals. Too little, and your dish might lack depth; too much, and it could become overly acidic. Air fryers cook food quickly, so balanced ingredients are crucial. If you're prepping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a>, 45 grams of tomato paste will give you the perfect base for a marinade or glaze.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is concentrated, so even small deviations in measurement can alter your dish. For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your ingredients. If you don’t have one, levelling off your tablespoons ensures accuracy. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> to put this knowledge to use.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Tomato Paste Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 3 tablespoons of tomato paste accurately. Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and scoop the paste, levelling it off with a knife. One tablespoon holds about 15 grams, so three will give you roughly 45 grams. For sticky ingredients like tomato paste, lightly oiling the spoon helps it slide off easily.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Tomato Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste is a versatile ingredient that adds richness to many air fryer dishes. It works wonderfully in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>, like roasted peppers or stuffed mushrooms. Mix it with herbs and oil for a quick marinade, or dilute it with water for a light sauce. The concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way, so 45 grams (3 tbsp) is often enough for a family-sized portion.</p>  

<p>You can also use tomato paste as a base for air fryer pizza or as a glaze for meats. Its thick consistency helps coatings stick, making it ideal for crispy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken wings</a>. For cleaning sticky residue from your air fryer basket, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Tomato Paste</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover tomato paste, transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate. It will keep for up to a week, or you can freeze it in ice cube trays for longer storage. Each cube holds about one tablespoon (15 grams), making future measurements a breeze.</p>

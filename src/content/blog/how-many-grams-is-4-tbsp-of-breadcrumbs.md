<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of breadcrumbs weigh approximately 28 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your coatings and toppings are perfectly portioned. Whether you're making crispy chicken or a golden fish fillet, knowing the exact weight helps achieve consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as uneven coatings can lead to undercooked or burnt spots. Breadcrumbs are a staple for creating that desirable crunch, and measuring them correctly ensures even cooking. Too little, and your food won’t crisp up; too much, and it might dry out. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Many recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients by weight for accuracy. If you’re adapting a recipe from volume (tbsp) to grams, this conversion is a game-changer. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or a vegetarian dish, knowing 4 tbsp of breadcrumbs equals 28 grams ensures perfection.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Breadcrumbs Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your breadcrumbs. Scooping directly from the bag can compress them, leading to inconsistent measurements. Lightly spooning the breadcrumbs into the tablespoon and levelling off the excess ensures you get the right amount. This method is especially useful for recipes requiring precise ratios, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer coatings</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 4 tbsp of Breadcrumbs</h2>  
<p>Four tablespoons of breadcrumbs are perfect for coating two chicken breasts or a medium-sized fish fillet. They’re also ideal for topping casseroles or adding crunch to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a>. If you’re meal prepping, knowing this measurement helps batch-cook with consistency.</p>  

<p>Breadcrumbs aren’t just for savoury dishes—they can also add texture to desserts like apple crisps.

And don’t forget to keep your air fryer in top condition with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to avoid buildup from crumbs and oils.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Breadcrumb Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp of breadcrumbs is roughly 7 grams, while 1 cup averages around 100 grams. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down, ensuring your air fryer meals turn out perfectly every time.</p>

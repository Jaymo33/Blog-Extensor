<p>Yes, you can absolutely put raw chicken in an air fryer - it's one of the best ways to achieve crispy skin and juicy meat without excess oil. The circulating hot air cooks chicken thoroughly while creating that desirable golden exterior. At airfryerrecipe.co.uk, we've tested countless methods to perfect air fried chicken.</p>

<h2>How to Safely Cook Raw Chicken in an Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Cooking raw chicken in an air fryer requires attention to food safety. Always start with fresh, properly stored chicken at refrigerator temperatures below 4°C. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels before seasoning - moisture prevents proper browning. For bone-in pieces like thighs or drumsticks, cook at 180°C for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for different cuts and weights.</p>
<p>The internal temperature must reach 75°C when measured with a meat thermometer in the thickest part. Never rely solely on cooking times as air fryer models vary. If cooking multiple pieces, avoid overcrowding - leave space between each piece for proper air circulation. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> offers dozens of tested variations from spicy wings to herb-crusted breasts.</p>

<h3>Best Chicken Cuts for Air Frying</h3>
<p>Boneless, skinless chicken breasts cook fastest (12-15 minutes at 190°C), while bone-in thighs take longer but stay juicier. Wings benefit from higher heat (200°C) for extra crispiness. Whole spatchcocked chickens can be air fried but require careful temperature monitoring. For beginners, we recommend starting with smaller cuts from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes collection</a> before attempting larger pieces.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes When Air Frying Raw Chicken</h2>
<p>Overcrowding the basket is the most frequent error - this steams rather than fries the chicken. Another mistake is skipping the preheat - always let your air fryer reach temperature before adding food. Using wet marinades without patting dry first prevents proper browning. Some cooks forget to flip halfway, resulting in uneven cooking.</p>
<p>Never assume cooking times are universal - factors like chicken thickness, starting temperature, and air fryer wattage affect results. After cooking, always let chicken rest 5 minutes before cutting to retain juices. For cleaning tips, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a> to prevent cross-contamination.</p>

<h3>Marinades and Seasonings That Work Best</h3>
<p>Dry rubs adhere better than wet marinades in an air fryer. For crispy skin, lightly coat with oil before applying spices. Acidic ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar can be used but may require shorter marinating times. Breaded chicken needs a light spray of oil to help coating adhere and crisp up properly.</p>

<h2>Food Safety Considerations</h2>
<p>Always wash hands, utensils, and surfaces after handling raw chicken to prevent cross-contamination. Never place cooked chicken back on surfaces that held raw chicken. Use separate cutting boards for meats and vegetables. If reheating previously cooked chicken in an air fryer, ensure it reaches 75°C throughout.</p>
<p>Thaw frozen chicken completely in the refrigerator before air frying - never cook from frozen unless your air fryer has a specific frozen food setting. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> for safe thawing methods. Leftovers should be refrigerated within two hours and consumed within three days.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h3>
<p>If chicken is browning too quickly, reduce temperature by 10°C. For dry chicken, try brining before cooking or using bone-in cuts. Sticking to the basket can be prevented by light oiling or parchment liners. Uneven cooking often means pieces are too crowded or different sizes - cook similar-sized pieces together.</p>

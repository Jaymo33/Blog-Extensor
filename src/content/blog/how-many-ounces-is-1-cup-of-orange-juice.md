<p>1 cup of orange juice equals approximately 8.45 ounces (or 8.45 oz) in the UK. This measurement is essential for precision in cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're making glazes, marinades, or desserts, knowing this conversion ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve even cooking and crispy results. Using too much or too little liquid, like orange juice, can throw off the balance. For example, a marinade with the wrong consistency might not coat evenly, leading to uneven browning. That’s why converting 1 cup of orange juice to ounces (8.45 oz) is so helpful.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with air fryer recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements. It’s a lifesaver for adapting traditional recipes to air fryer cooking. Plus, many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> use orange juice in glazes or sauces, so this conversion comes in handy often.</p>  

<h3>How to measure orange juice for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup or a kitchen scale. Pour the orange juice to the 1-cup mark, or weigh it to 8.45 ounces. If your recipe calls for a different amount, you can easily scale up or down. For example, half a cup would be 4.23 ounces, and two cups would be 16.9 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for orange juice in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Orange juice isn’t just for drinking—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes. It adds brightness to marinades for chicken or shrimp, balances sweetness in glazes for desserts, and even tenderises meats. For a quick and tasty dish, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>orange-glazed chicken</a> recipe, where precise measurements ensure the perfect sticky-sweet finish.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in baking. Orange juice can replace some of the liquid in cakes or cookies for a citrusy twist. Just remember: 1 cup of orange juice equals 8.45 ounces, so adjust other wet ingredients accordingly. And don’t forget to clean your air fryer afterward—sticky citrus residues can build up. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has tips for keeping it spotless.</p>  

<h3>Converting other orange juice measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe uses millilitres or grams, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup (240 ml) of orange juice weighs about 240 grams, which is roughly 8.45 ounces. For smaller amounts, 1 tablespoon is about 0.5 ounces, and 1 teaspoon is roughly 0.17 ounces. These conversions are handy for adjusting recipes on the fly.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with orange juice in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Freshly squeezed orange juice works best for flavour, but store-bought is fine too—just check for added sugars. When using it in marinades, let the meat sit for at least 30 minutes for maximum flavour. For glazes, reduce the juice slightly on the stove first to thicken it, then brush it on during the last few minutes of air frying.</p>  

<p>If you’re exploring more citrus-based recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> has plenty of ideas, from orange-infused cakes to tangy glazes for pastries.

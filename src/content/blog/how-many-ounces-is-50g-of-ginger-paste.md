Whether you're whipping up a marinade or adding a punch of flavour to your meal, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ginger paste can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. Too little, and the flavour might be underwhelming; too much, and it could overpower the dish. The air fryer’s intense heat means ingredients cook quickly, so precision is key. For example, a recipe calling for 50g of ginger paste (1.76 oz) ensures balanced flavours in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a>, rely on precise weights for best results.

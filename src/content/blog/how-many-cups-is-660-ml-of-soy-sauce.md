<p>660 ml of soy sauce equals approximately 2.79 cups. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or seasoning a dish in your air fryer, getting the measurements right is key to perfect results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how important precision is when cooking, especially with bold ingredients like soy sauce.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of soy sauce ensures your dishes aren’t too salty or bland. Air fryers cook food quickly, so even small measurement errors can affect taste and texture. For example, a stir-fry or glaze with too much soy sauce can overpower other flavours. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Many recipes, especially Asian-inspired dishes, rely on precise soy sauce quantities. Whether you're making teriyaki chicken or a soy-based marinade for tofu, knowing how many cups 660 ml translates to helps streamline your prep. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> for ideas on using soy sauce in air fryer meals.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 660 ml of Soy Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use a standard mug or glass. A typical UK mug holds around 250 ml, so 660 ml would be roughly 2.6 mugs. For more precise results, use a kitchen scale—660 ml of soy sauce weighs about 684 grams. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> includes weight-based measurements for foolproof cooking.</p>  

<h2>Converting 660 ml of Soy Sauce for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're scaling a recipe up or down, knowing the cup equivalent of 660 ml of soy sauce is handy. For instance, halving a recipe that calls for 660 ml means using 1.4 cups instead. This is particularly useful for meal preppers or smaller households. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> for batch-cooking inspiration.</p>  

<p>Different brands of soy sauce vary in saltiness, so always taste as you go. Light soy sauce is saltier than dark, so adjust measurements accordingly. If you’re experimenting with homemade sauces, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> will help keep your appliance spotless after sticky marinades.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>Pouring soy sauce directly from the bottle often leads to over-measuring. Instead, use a spoon or measuring jug for accuracy. Also, remember that 660 ml of soy sauce in the UK is the same as in the US—cup sizes are standardized in recipes.

<p>535 ml of honey is approximately 2.25 cups in the UK and 2.26 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're whipping up a cake or glazing chicken, knowing how to convert 535 ml of honey to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Honey is a sticky ingredient that can be tricky to measure, especially when converting between millilitres and cups. Using the wrong amount can throw off the balance of your recipe, affecting texture and sweetness. For air fryer recipes, precision is key to achieving the best results. If you're looking for more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>
<p>Many bakers and cooks prefer using cups for convenience, but ml measurements are often more accurate. When working with honey, its viscosity means it can settle differently in a cup, so levelling it off is crucial. For recipes like honey-glazed salmon or sticky desserts, getting the measurement right makes all the difference. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration.</p>

<h2>UK vs US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>It's important to note that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 535 ml of honey converts to about 2.25 cups in the UK and 2.26 cups in the US. For air fryer cooking, these small differences can add up, so always check which system your recipe uses.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Honey Without Sticky Mess</h3>
<p>Measuring honey can be messy, but there are tricks to make it easier. Lightly greasing your measuring cup or spoon with oil helps the honey slide out cleanly. Alternatively, warm the honey slightly to make it less viscous. If you're using an air fryer for honey-based dishes, like glazed chicken or desserts, precise measurements ensure even cooking.

<h2>Common Recipes Using 535 ml of Honey</h2>
<p>535 ml of honey is a common measurement in many recipes, from marinades to baked goods. For example, honey-glazed chicken or honey cake often call for this amount. When using an air fryer, honey helps create a delicious caramelised finish. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on how to use honey in your cooking.</p>
<p>Another popular use for 535 ml of honey is in homemade granola or energy bars. The honey acts as a natural sweetener and binder. In an air fryer, these recipes cook quickly and evenly, giving you a crispy texture without burning.

<h3>Cleaning Up After Using Honey</h3>
<p>Honey can be sticky and hard to clean, especially from air fryer baskets. To make cleanup easier, soak the basket in warm, soapy water before scrubbing. For stubborn residue, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips. Keeping your air fryer clean ensures it works efficiently and lasts longer.</p>

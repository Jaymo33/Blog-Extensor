<h2>Tips for Working with Honey in the Air Fryer</h2>

<p>Another tip is to apply honey in thin layers during the last few minutes of cooking. This prevents burning and ensures a glossy finish. Whether you’re using 210 ml of honey or a smaller amount, these tricks will help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Honey</h3>
<p>If you have leftover honey after measuring out 210 ml, store it in an airtight container at room temperature. Honey has a long shelf life, but it can crystallise over time. To liquefy it again, gently warm the jar in a bowl of hot water. This ensures your honey is ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

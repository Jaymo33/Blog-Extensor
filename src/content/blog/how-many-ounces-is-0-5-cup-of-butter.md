<p>0.5 cup of butter equals 4 ounces (113 grams). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a batch of cookies or preparing a savoury dish, knowing how to convert 0.5 cup of butter to ounces ensures consistency and perfect results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of butter is crucial for achieving the desired texture and flavour in your dishes. Too much butter can make baked goods greasy, while too little can leave them dry. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements like 0.5 cup of butter to ounces help maintain the balance of ingredients, ensuring even cooking and perfect crispiness. If you're exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, this conversion will come in handy often.</p>  

<p>Butter is often measured in cups, but many recipes, especially those from the UK or Europe, use weight measurements like ounces or grams. Converting 0.5 cup of butter to ounces (4 oz) simplifies the process, especially if you're using a kitchen scale. This is particularly useful for air fryer cooking, where precision can affect cooking times and results.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 0.5 cup of butter in ounces</h2>  
<p>Measuring 0.5 cup of butter in ounces is straightforward if you know the conversion. One standard cup of butter equals 8 ounces, so half a cup is 4 ounces. If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 4 ounces of butter. This method is especially helpful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversions</a>, where accuracy is key.</p>  

<h3>Using a kitchen scale</h3>  
<p>A kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure butter, especially for air fryer recipes. Simply place your butter on the scale and measure out 4 ounces (or 113 grams). This eliminates the guesswork and ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. For more tips on measuring ingredients, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 cup of butter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Half a cup of butter (4 ounces) is a common measurement in many air fryer recipes, from crispy potatoes to golden-brown pastries. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potato recipes</a> often call for this amount to achieve that perfect crunch. Knowing how many ounces are in 0.5 cup of butter ensures you can replicate these dishes with ease.</p>  

<p>Butter is also a key ingredient in air fryer desserts, like cakes and cookies. Whether you're making a batch of chocolate chip cookies or a moist sponge cake, measuring 0.5 cup of butter accurately (4 ounces) guarantees the right texture and flavour.

<h3>Butter substitutes and conversions</h3>  
<p>If you're using a butter substitute, like margarine or oil, the conversion may vary slightly. However, for most purposes, 0.5 cup of butter (4 ounces) can be replaced with an equal amount of these substitutes. Just be mindful of the fat content, as it can affect cooking times in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for measuring butter without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.5 cup of butter using the markings on the butter wrapper. Most butter sticks are marked with tablespoon measurements, making it easy to cut off the right amount. For 0.5 cup (4 ounces), you’ll need 8 tablespoons or one standard stick of butter in the UK.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is to use water displacement for measuring butter. Fill a measuring cup with 0.5 cup of water, then add butter until the water level rises to 1 cup. The butter you’ve added will equal 0.5 cup (4 ounces). This method is great for air fryer recipes where precision matters, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookie recipes</a>.</p>

<p>5 grams of sesame oil equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise measurements in air fryer cooking, where accuracy can make or break a dish. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient quantities to deliver perfectly crispy results. Using too much or too little sesame oil can affect texture and flavour, especially in dishes like stir-fries or marinades. For example, a recipe calling for 5g of sesame oil (0.18 ounces) ensures the right balance of moisture and crispiness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement conversions.</p>  

<p>Sesame oil is a staple in many Asian-inspired air fryer recipes, adding a rich, nutty flavour. Whether you’re making crispy tofu or glazed chicken, measuring 5g of sesame oil correctly ensures your dish isn’t overly greasy or dry. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 5g of sesame oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 5g of sesame oil (0.18 ounces) using a teaspoon. One teaspoon of sesame oil weighs roughly 4.5g, so a slightly heaped teaspoon will get you close to 5g. For more precise measurements, invest in a digital scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5g of sesame oil in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Five grams of sesame oil is often used to lightly coat vegetables, proteins, or tofu before air frying. This small amount adds flavour without making the dish soggy. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for crispy Brussels sprouts or honey-glazed salmon.</p>  

<p>Another popular use for 5g of sesame oil is in marinades or dressings. Combined with soy sauce, garlic, and ginger, it creates a delicious glaze for meats or veggies. Just remember—sesame oil has a strong flavour, so a little goes a long way.

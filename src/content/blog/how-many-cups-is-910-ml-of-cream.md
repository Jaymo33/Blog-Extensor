<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when dealing with ingredients like cream. The density and consistency of cream mean that 910 ml won't always weigh the same as other liquids. In the UK, a standard cup holds 240 ml, while in the US, it's 236.6 ml. This slight difference means 910 ml of cream translates to roughly 3.85 cups in the UK and 3.8 cups in the US. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements like these can make all the difference in texture and flavour.</p>
<p>If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you'll often find measurements in both millilitres and cups. This dual measurement system helps avoid confusion and ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. Cream is a versatile ingredient, used in everything from sauces to desserts, so getting the conversion right is key.</p>

<h2>Why Accuracy Matters</h2>
<p>When baking or cooking, especially in an air fryer, accuracy is crucial. Too much or too little cream can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, adding 910 ml of cream instead of the correct cup measurement could make a sauce too runny or a cake too dense. This is why understanding the conversion from millilitres to cups is so important.</p>

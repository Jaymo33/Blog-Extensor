<p>To reheat meatballs in an air fryer, preheat to 160°C (320°F) and cook for 3–5 minutes until heated through. This method ensures they stay juicy while crisping up beautifully—far better than a microwave. Whether you’ve got leftover homemade meatballs or store-bought ones, your air fryer is the best tool for the job.

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Meatballs?</h2>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air around food, giving reheated meatballs a crispy exterior without drying them out. Unlike microwaves, which can make them rubbery, or ovens, which take longer, air fryers deliver even heat quickly. This is especially handy for meal-prepped meatballs or last-minute dinners.

<p>Another advantage is portion control. You can reheat just a few meatballs at a time, perfect for solo meals. Plus, air fryers preheat in minutes, making them ideal for busy weeknights. For frozen meatballs, adjust the time slightly—we’ll cover that below. Need to convert temperatures?

<h3>Best Temperature for Reheating Meatballs</h3>  
<p>160°C (320°F) is the sweet spot for reheating meatballs in an air fryer. This temperature warms them thoroughly without overcooking. Higher heat risks drying them out, while lower heat may leave the centres cold. If your meatballs are particularly large or dense, add 1–2 minutes.

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Meatballs</h2>  
<p>Start by preheating your air fryer to 160°C (320°F). Arrange the meatballs in a single layer, leaving space between them for airflow. Cook for 3–5 minutes, shaking the basket halfway. For extra crispiness, spritz lightly with oil. Always check the internal temperature reaches 74°C (165°F) for food safety. Leftover sauce? Warm it separately to avoid sogginess.</p>  

<p>If reheating frozen meatballs, add 2–3 minutes to the time. No need to thaw—just ensure they’re piping hot inside. For saucy meatballs, place them on a piece of foil or an air fryer liner to prevent mess.

<h3>Tips for Juicy, Crispy Meatballs</h3>  
<p>Avoid overcrowding the basket, as this leads to uneven heating. If reheating a large batch, work in layers. For gluten-free or lean meatballs, reduce the time slightly to prevent dryness. Brushing with a bit of broth or sauce before reheating can boost moisture. Experiment with herbs or grated cheese for extra flavour.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>  
<p>Overheating is the top culprit for dry meatballs. Stick to 5 minutes max unless they’re frozen. Skipping the preheat can also result in uneven results. Never stack meatballs—they’ll steam instead of crisp. Using too much oil? A light spray is enough.

<p>Another mistake is reheating meatballs straight from the fridge without spacing them out. Cold centres take longer to warm, risking overcooked edges. If your air fryer runs hot, lower the temperature by 10°C. Always let meatballs rest for a minute after reheating—they’ll retain more juices.</p>

<p>325 grams of milk is roughly equivalent to 1.37 cups in the UK or 1.35 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures your recipe turns out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of milk is crucial for recipes, particularly in air fryer cooking where consistency affects texture and cooking time. Too much milk can make batters too runny, while too little can dry out dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or custards. For air fryer recipes, precision ensures even cooking and perfect results every time.</p>  
<p>Milk density can vary slightly depending on fat content, but for most standard whole or semi-skimmed milk, 325 grams translates to just over 1.3 cups. If you're using a digital scale, weighing ingredients like milk eliminates guesswork and improves accuracy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it's 240ml. This small difference means 325 grams of milk equals approximately 1.37 cups in the UK and 1.35 cups in the US. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, always check whether it uses UK or US measurements to avoid errors.</p>  

<h3>Converting Grams to Cups for Different Milk Types</h3>  
<p>Whole milk, skimmed milk, and plant-based alternatives like almond or oat milk have slightly different densities. For most dairy milk, 325 grams will still hover around 1.35–1.37 cups, but always double-check if using non-dairy substitutes. A kitchen scale is your best friend for exact measurements, especially when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour milk to the 1.35-cup mark (US) or 1.37-cup mark (UK) for 325 grams. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to slight inaccuracies. For air fryer recipes, even small measurement errors can affect cooking times, so precision is key.</p>  
<p>Another handy trick is to remember that 100 grams of milk is roughly 0.4 cups, making it easier to scale up or down. Need to clean your air fryer after a milky recipe? Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for hassle-free maintenance.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 325 Grams of Milk</h3>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for single-serving <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast</a> bakes, pancakes, or custards in the air fryer. Whether you're making a small batch of muffins or a creamy pasta sauce, knowing how many cups 325 grams of milk equals ensures consistent results.

<p>0.66 cup of sunflower seeds equals approximately 3.17 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for consistent results. Whether you’re roasting sunflower seeds for a snack or incorporating them into a dish, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions effortless so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. For example, using too many sunflower seeds might overcrowd the basket, preventing proper air circulation. Conversely, too few might burn quickly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess. Whether you’re making a crunchy topping or a protein-packed snack, precision is key.</p>  

<p>Sunflower seeds are a versatile ingredient, perfect for adding texture to salads, baked goods, or even as a standalone snack. Measuring 0.66 cup of sunflower seeds to ounces ensures you get the right balance of flavour and crunch. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for creative ways to use sunflower seeds in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sunflower seeds correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a kitchen scale to weigh your sunflower seeds. If you don’t have one, spoon the seeds into a measuring cup and level them off. Avoid packing them down, as this can lead to an inaccurate measurement. Remember, 0.66 cup of sunflower seeds to ounces is roughly 3.17 oz, but slight variations can occur based on seed size.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for sunflower seeds in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Sunflower seeds are a fantastic addition to air fryer recipes, offering a nutty flavour and satisfying crunch. Try them in homemade granola, as a coating for chicken, or roasted with spices for a quick snack. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> often feature sunflower seeds for an extra nutritional boost. They’re rich in healthy fats and protein, making them a great choice for meal prep.</p>

For best results, spread them evenly in the air fryer basket and shake occasionally.

<h3>Storing sunflower seeds for freshness</h3>

Proper storage ensures your seeds retain their flavour and crunch for future recipes.</p>

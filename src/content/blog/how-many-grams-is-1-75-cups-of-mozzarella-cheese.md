<h2>Why Accurate Cheese Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of mozzarella cheese ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. Too little cheese, and your pizza might lack that stretchy goodness.

<p>Different brands of mozzarella cheese can vary slightly in density, so weighing is more reliable than measuring by volume. If you're using fresh mozzarella instead of shredded, note that it packs differently—200 grams may look like less in the cup. Always fluff shredded cheese lightly before measuring to avoid compacting it.</p>

<h3>Shredded vs. Fresh Mozzarella: Weight Differences</h3>
<p>Shredded mozzarella weighs about 115 grams per cup, while fresh mozzarella (like bocconcini) is denser at around 140 grams per cup when chopped. For 1.75 cups, that’s roughly 200 grams shredded or 245 grams fresh. Adjust your recipes accordingly, especially for air fryer dishes where moisture content affects crispiness. Need inspiration?

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Cheese</h3>
<p>Packing shredded mozzarella tightly into a cup can add up to 25% extra weight, throwing off your recipe. Always spoon it lightly into the measuring cup and level it off. For fresh mozzarella, pat it dry before chopping to remove excess moisture, which affects weight. Remember, 1.75 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese in grams should be around 200 for consistent air fryer results.</p>

<p>635 ml of tomato sauce is roughly 2.68 cups in the US or 2.23 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring you get the right consistency and flavour. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a hearty stew, accurate measurements make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of tomato sauce ensures your dish isn’t too dry or overly saucy. Air fryers cook food quickly, so imbalances in liquid ingredients can affect texture. For example, 635 ml of tomato sauce in a lasagna should be evenly distributed to avoid sogginess. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements. Precision also helps when scaling recipes up or down for meal prep.</p>  

<p>Tomato sauce is a staple in many dishes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> to vegetarian options. Whether you're using tinned or homemade sauce, knowing the cup equivalent of 635 ml ensures consistency. A slight variation can alter cooking times, especially in air fryers where evaporation happens faster. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> tailored for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cups affects how you measure 635 ml of tomato sauce. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. This means 635 ml converts to 2.68 US cups or 2.23 UK cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid measurement errors. For baking or sauces, even small discrepancies can impact results.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 635 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard household items to estimate 635 ml of tomato sauce. A UK mug holds about 284 ml, so 2.23 mugs equal 635 ml. For US measurements, 2.68 standard cups will do. Alternatively, a 330 ml soda can plus half another can approximates 635 ml.

<p>For thicker sauces, like passata or purée, 635 ml may weigh differently due to density. Stirring before measuring ensures accuracy. If your air fryer recipe calls for 635 ml of tomato sauce, levelling off the top of your measuring cup avoids excess. Need inspiration?

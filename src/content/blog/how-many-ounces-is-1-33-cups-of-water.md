<p>1.33 cups of water equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise measurements in cooking, especially when using an air fryer where accuracy can affect results. Whether you're preparing a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> or adjusting liquid quantities, knowing this conversion ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to achieve the perfect texture and doneness. Too much or too little liquid can alter cooking times and outcomes. For example, when making a marinade or sauce for chicken, 1.33 cups of water (10.64 ounces) might be needed to balance flavours. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken category</a>, require specific liquid measurements. Using the correct amount of water ensures even cooking and prevents drying out. Whether you're baking, roasting, or steaming, 1.33 cups of water converted to ounces can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.33 cups of water accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring 1.33 cups of water might seem tricky, but it's straightforward with the right tools. A liquid measuring cup with clear markings is ideal. Fill it to the 1-cup line, then add another 1/3 cup to reach 1.33 cups total. This equals 10.64 ounces, as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>For those without a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can be used. Simply weigh out 10.64 ounces of water for the same result. This method is especially useful for recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> that require precision. Remember, water's weight is consistent, making conversions reliable.</p>

<h3>Converting 1.33 cups of water to other units</h3>
<p>Beyond ounces, you might need to convert 1.33 cups of water to millilitres or grams. 1.33 cups is roughly 315 millilitres or 315 grams, since water's density is 1g/ml. These conversions are handy when using international recipes or scales with different units. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers these in detail.</p>

<p>0.5 cups of granulated sugar equals approximately 100 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you’re whipping up cookies, cakes, or desserts, knowing the exact gram equivalent ensures consistency and perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you achieve culinary perfection with accurate conversions and easy-to-follow guides.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of granulated sugar is crucial for achieving the right texture and sweetness in your air fryer recipes. Too little sugar can leave your baked goods dry and bland, while too much can cause excessive browning or even burning. The air fryer’s intense heat requires precise measurements to avoid uneven cooking. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookie recipes</a> rely on exact sugar quantities for that perfect chewiness.</p>
<p>Granulated sugar also plays a key role in caramelisation, which enhances flavour and colour in air-fried desserts. If you’re converting from cups to grams, 0.5 cups of granulated sugar (100g) ensures your treats come out just right. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Granulated Sugar Correctly</h2>
<p>Measuring sugar by volume (cups) can be tricky, as packing density varies. For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 100 grams directly. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the sugar with a spoon before lightly scooping it into a measuring cup. Level it off with a straight edge for consistency. This method ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>While 0.5 cups of granulated sugar is universally close to 100 grams, slight variations exist between US and UK cup sizes. US cups are 240ml, whereas UK cups are 250ml. For air fryer recipes, this minor difference won’t drastically affect your results, but it’s worth noting for precision baking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> accounts for both standards.</p>

<h2>Common Air Fryer Recipes Using 0.5 Cups of Sugar</h2>
<p>Many air fryer desserts call for 0.5 cups of granulated sugar, including brownies, muffins, and shortbread. For instance, our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer chocolate chip cookies</a> use this measurement for ideal sweetness. The sugar helps create a crisp exterior while keeping the centre soft. Always preheat your air fryer for even cooking and better texture.</p>
<p>If you’re experimenting with savoury dishes, remember that sugar can balance acidity in sauces or glazes. A touch of sugar in air-fried BBQ chicken or glazed carrots enhances flavour without overpowering.

<h3>Adjusting Sugar for Dietary Needs</h3>
<p>If you’re reducing sugar, note that substitutes like erythritol or stevia have different weights. Always check conversion charts for alternative sweeteners to maintain recipe integrity. For cleaning sticky air fryer baskets after sugary recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>

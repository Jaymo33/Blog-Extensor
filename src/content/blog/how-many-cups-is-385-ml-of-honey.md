<p>385 ml of honey is roughly 1.63 cups. This conversion is essential for precise baking or cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a glaze or sweetening a dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Honey is thicker and denser than water, so volume conversions aren’t always straightforward. Using too much or too little can throw off the texture and sweetness of your dish. For air fryer recipes, precision is key—whether you're making sticky glazes for chicken or drizzling honey over roasted vegetables. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you’ll find plenty of dishes where exact honey measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<p>If you're working with 385 ml of honey, it’s helpful to know that this amount is just over 1.5 cups. This conversion is particularly useful for UK bakers, as metric measurements are standard here.

<h3>How to Measure 385 ml of Honey Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the honey slowly to avoid air bubbles, and level it off with a spatula. For sticky ingredients like honey, lightly greasing the measuring cup can help it slide out easily. This method ensures you get the right amount for recipes like honey-glazed salmon or air-fried desserts.</p>  

<h2>Converting 385 ml of Honey for Different Recipes</h2>

Knowing both systems helps when adapting recipes for your air fryer. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>honey-glazed chicken</a> relies on precise honey quantities for the perfect caramelisation.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 385 ml of honey is equivalent to about 13 fluid ounces. This conversion is handy for larger batches or meal prep. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>0.5 cup of tahini equals approximately 4.23 ounces (oz). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and flavour. Whether you're making hummus, dressings, or marinades, knowing how many ounces are in 0.5 cup of tahini helps you nail the recipe every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate conversions to make your cooking effortless.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate tahini measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of tahini can make or break your dish. Too little, and your hummus might lack creaminess; too much, and it could overpower other flavours. In air fryer cooking, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect consistency. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer hummus recipe</a> relies on this conversion for best results. Tahini’s density means volume-to-weight conversions like 0.5 cup to ounces are crucial for accuracy.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients for reliability, especially in air fryer recipes. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, but if you’re using cups, our conversion ensures you’re spot-on. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements. Whether you’re meal prepping or experimenting, knowing 0.5 cup of tahini equals 4.23 oz saves time and hassle.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tahini correctly</h3>  
<p>Tahini’s thick, sticky consistency can make measuring tricky. For 0.5 cup, lightly spray your measuring cup with oil to help the tahini slide out easily. Alternatively, use the spoon-and-level method to avoid air pockets. If you’re converting 0.5 cup of tahini to ounces frequently, consider weighing it directly for consistency. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> often use tahini, so mastering this measurement opens up more culinary possibilities.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 cup of tahini</h2>  
<p>Half a cup of tahini (4.23 oz) is a versatile quantity for many air fryer dishes. It’s enough for a batch of creamy hummus, a flavourful marinade for chicken, or a drizzle for roasted vegetables. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love tahini for its rich, nutty flavour and how well it pairs with air-fried foods. From dressings to dips, this measurement is a kitchen staple for Middle Eastern-inspired meals.</p>  

<p>For those exploring plant-based cooking, 0.5 cup of tahini can elevate tofu or vegetable dishes. Its healthy fats and protein make it a nutritious addition to your air fryer creations.

<h3>Converting tahini for UK measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, recipes often use grams or ounces, so converting 0.5 cup of tahini to 4.23 oz simplifies following international recipes. If your scale uses grams, 0.5 cup equals roughly 120 grams. This conversion is handy when adapting US-based air fryer recipes to UK kitchens.

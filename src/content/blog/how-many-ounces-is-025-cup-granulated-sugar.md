Try chilling your dough before air frying and check your leavening agents are fresh."

<p>0.25 cup of granulated sugar equals approximately 1.76 ounces (50 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up cookies or cakes, knowing this conversion ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than traditional ovens, which means ingredient ratios are crucial. Too much sugar can cause over-browning or burning, while too little can leave your baked goods dry. Using 0.25 cup of granulated sugar (1.76 oz) ensures balanced sweetness and texture.</p>
<p>For best results, always use a kitchen scale when measuring sugar for air fryer recipes. If you don't have one, fluff the sugar in its container before spooning it into your measuring cup. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.25 cup of granulated sugar without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can still measure 0.25 cup of granulated sugar accurately. Use a standard UK measuring cup and fill it to the quarter mark. Level off the top with a straight edge for precision. Remember, 0.25 cup equals 4 tablespoons or 12 teaspoons of granulated sugar.</p>
<p>For consistent results in your air fryer, avoid packing the sugar down when measuring. Granulated sugar should sit loosely in the cup. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section has plenty of sweet treats that use this exact measurement.</p>

<h3>Converting 0.25 cup granulated sugar to other units</h3>
<p>Besides ounces, you might need to know other conversions for 0.25 cup of granulated sugar. It's equivalent to 50 grams or 0.11 pounds. These conversions come in handy when following international recipes or using different measuring tools.</p>

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 0.25 cup sugar</h2>
<p>Many air fryer desserts call for 0.25 cup of granulated sugar. This includes small-batch cookies, mug cakes, and fruit crumbles. The moderate amount provides just enough sweetness without overwhelming other flavours.</p>
<p>Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> that use this measurement for perfectly portioned treats. Remember to adjust cooking times slightly as sugar content affects browning in air fryers.</p>

<h3>Storing granulated sugar for air fryer baking</h3>
<p>Keep your granulated sugar in an airtight container to maintain freshness. Humidity can cause clumping, which affects measurement accuracy. For best results when measuring 0.25 cup portions, store sugar in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting sugar measurements in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>If your air fryer baked goods turn out too sweet or not sweet enough, double-check your sugar measurements. Even small variations can affect the final product. Always use the same measuring tools throughout a recipe for consistency.</p>

<h3>Alternative sweeteners to granulated sugar</h3>
<p>If you're out of granulated sugar, you can substitute other sweeteners in your air fryer recipes. However, they may require different measurements. For example, 0.25 cup of granulated sugar equals about 0.25 cup of caster sugar but only 3 tablespoons of honey.</p>

<p>60 ml of almond milk equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert 60 ml of almond milk to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Too much liquid, like almond milk, can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. Converting 60 ml of almond milk to cups (0.25 cups) helps maintain balance in recipes like air-fried pancakes or batters.

<p>Almond milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its consistency varies by brand. Measuring 60 ml accurately ensures your recipes, whether sweet or savoury, turn out just right. If you're experimenting with air fryer desserts, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 60 ml of Almond Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard tablespoon. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so four tablespoons equal 60 ml (or 0.25 cups). For air fryer recipes requiring small amounts, like glazes or marinades, this method works perfectly. Need more measurement hacks? Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for handy guides.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 60 ml of Almond Milk</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 60 ml of almond milk, from fluffy muffins to crispy coatings. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> often use this measurement for moist, dairy-free results. Whether you're making a batter or a sauce, 60 ml (0.25 cups) of almond milk adds creaminess without overpowering flavours.</p>  

<p>Almond milk’s mild taste makes it versatile. Use 60 ml in savoury dishes like air-fried mac and cheese or sweet treats like churros. For more ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>  

<h3>Does Almond Milk Behave Differently Than Dairy Milk in Conversions?</h3>  
<p>Almond milk and dairy milk measure similarly by volume, so 60 ml equals 0.25 cups for both. However, almond milk’s lower fat content can affect texture in air fryer recipes. Adjust cooking times slightly if substituting almond milk in recipes designed for dairy.</p>

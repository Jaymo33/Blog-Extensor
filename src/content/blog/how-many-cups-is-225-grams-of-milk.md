<p>225 grams of milk is roughly equivalent to 0.95 cups in the UK or 0.89 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer to bake or cook recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're making a cake, custard, or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of milk in your recipes is crucial for texture and consistency. Too much milk can make your batter too runny, while too little can result in a dry or crumbly dish. For air fryer recipes, precision is even more important because the cooking environment is more intense than a conventional oven.

<p>Milk is a common ingredient in many recipes, from pancakes to creamy pasta sauces. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, the cup measurements can vary slightly. In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it's 240ml. This small difference can affect your results, so it's always best to double-check which system your recipe uses.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 225 Grams of Milk Without Scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 225 grams of milk using a measuring cup. Since milk has a similar density to water, 225 grams is roughly 225ml. In the UK, this is just under one cup (250ml), while in the US, it's slightly less than a cup (240ml). For best results, use a liquid measuring cup and fill it to the 225ml mark.</p>
<p>Another handy trick is to use tablespoons. There are approximately 15ml in a tablespoon, so 225 grams of milk equals about 15 tablespoons. This method is especially useful for smaller quantities or if you're adjusting a recipe on the fly.

<h2>Tips for Measuring Milk in an Air Fryer Recipe</h2>
<p>When using milk in air fryer recipes, it's best to measure it by weight for the most accurate results. If your recipe calls for 225 grams of milk, use a digital scale to weigh it out precisely. This is especially important for baked goods, where the ratio of wet to dry ingredients can make or break your dish.</p>
<p>Another tip is to use room-temperature milk unless the recipe specifies otherwise. Cold milk can affect the cooking time and texture of your dish in the air fryer.

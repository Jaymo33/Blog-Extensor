At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accuracy is for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Vinegar Measurements</h2>  
<p>When converting 460 ml of vinegar to cups, it's essential to know which cup measurement you're using. The US customary cup holds 240 ml, while the UK imperial cup is slightly larger at 284 ml. This difference means 460 ml of vinegar translates to roughly 1.94 US cups or 1.61 UK cups. For air fryer recipes, especially those involving marinades or glazes, getting this right ensures balanced flavours.</p>  

<p>If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always check whether it follows US or UK measurements. A slight miscalculation could alter the acidity or consistency of your dish. For example, a vinegar-based glaze for air-fried salmon needs the right balance to avoid overpowering the fish.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Vinegar Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Vinegar plays a critical role in cooking, from tenderising meats to adding brightness to sauces. Too much can make a dish overly acidic, while too little might leave it bland.

<h2>Converting 460 ml of Vinegar for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking with vinegar, such as in cakes or cookies, requires exact measurements for chemical reactions like leavening. If a recipe calls for 460 ml of vinegar and you’re using US cups, measure out 1.94 cups. For UK bakers, 1.61 cups will do. This accuracy ensures your baked goods rise properly and taste balanced.</p>  

<p>For air fryer baking, such as our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, vinegar often reacts with baking soda for lift. A mis-measured 460 ml could lead to dense or overly tangy results. Always double-check your conversions to avoid disappointment.</p>  

<h3>Practical Tips for Measuring Vinegar</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate 460 ml to cups conversion. Pour slowly to the correct line, checking at eye level. For sticky ingredients like balsamic vinegar, lightly grease the cup for easier pouring. If precision is key, a digital kitchen scale can also help verify your measurements.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Vinegar Types</h3>  
<p>Not all vinegars have the same density, which can slightly affect measurements.

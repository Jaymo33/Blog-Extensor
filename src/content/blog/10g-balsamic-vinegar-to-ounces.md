<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can approximate 10g of balsamic vinegar using standard measuring spoons. About two teaspoons of balsamic vinegar will give you roughly 10g or 0.35 ounces. Remember that viscosity can affect volume measurements, so this method isn't as precise as weighing.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of beef stock can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little liquid, and your meal might turn out dry or undercooked. Too much, and you risk soggy results or overflowing. Air fryers rely on rapid air circulation, so precise measurements ensure even cooking. This is especially important for recipes like stews or casseroles, where liquid ratios are key.

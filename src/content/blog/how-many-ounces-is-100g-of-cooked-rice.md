At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify measurements so you can focus on cooking delicious meals effortlessly.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 100g of Cooked Rice to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, but some kitchen scales or older cookbooks may still reference ounces. Converting 100g of cooked rice to ounces (3.53 oz) ensures consistency, whether you're reheating leftovers or preparing a fresh batch. If you're using an air fryer for meal prep, precise measurements help avoid overloading the basket, ensuring even cooking.</p>  

<p>For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. It covers everything from weights to temperatures, making cooking simpler. Whether you're working with rice, proteins, or vegetables, accurate measurements are key to perfect results.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 100g of Cooked Rice Accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 100g of cooked rice. If your scale displays ounces, you'll see it’s roughly 3.53 oz. For those without scales, a standard UK measuring cup holds about 200g of cooked rice, so half a cup will give you approximately 100g (or 3.53 oz).</p>  

<h3>Tips for Air Fryer Rice Portions</h3>  
<p>When reheating rice in your air fryer, 100g (3.53 oz) is a good single-serving size. Spread it evenly in the basket to ensure crispiness without clumping. For meal prep, portioning rice in 100g amounts helps with quick, balanced meals. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for creative ways to use cooked rice, from fried rice to stuffed peppers.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 100g of Cooked Rice</h2>  
<p>100g of cooked rice (3.53 oz) is a versatile portion for air fryer dishes. It pairs well with proteins like chicken or tofu, or can be the base for a quick stir-fry. If you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-packed meals</a>, this amount ensures a balanced ratio of grains to veggies.</p>  

<p>Leftover rice? Reheat 100g portions in the air fryer at 180°C for 3–5 minutes for a crispy texture. Just spritz lightly with oil and stir halfway through.

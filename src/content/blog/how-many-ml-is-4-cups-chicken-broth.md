Whether you're making a hearty soup or a rich sauce, knowing how to convert cups to millilitres will help you achieve consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when cooking with an air fryer, as the compact space requires balanced liquid ratios. Too much broth can make dishes soggy, while too little may dry them out. Using 946 ml of chicken broth for 4.0 cups ensures your recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken casseroles</a>, turn out perfectly. This measurement is especially useful for British cooks, where metric units are standard.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, such as those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, list ingredients in millilitres for accuracy. Converting 4.0 cups of chicken broth to 946 ml helps avoid guesswork and guarantees your dish’s success. Whether you're batch-cooking or meal prepping, this conversion ensures uniformity across servings.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 4.0 Cups of Chicken Broth Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a liquid measuring cup with clear millilitre markings. Fill it to the 946 ml line to match 4.0 cups of chicken broth. If your cup measures in imperial units, remember that 1 cup equals 236.6 ml, so 4.0 cups will total 946 ml.</p>  
<p>When preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken-based air fryer recipes</a>, like stews or gravies, this precision ensures the right texture. For thicker broths, stir gently before measuring to distribute fats evenly. Avoid packing or compressing the liquid, as this can skew the volume.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 4.0 US cups equal 946 ml, UK cups differ slightly at 284 ml per cup. However, most modern recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk’s conversion chart</a>, standardise to US measurements. Always check the recipe’s origin to avoid discrepancies.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 4.0 Cups (946 ml) of Chicken Broth</h2>

It’s also perfect for deglazing pans or creating marinades.</p>

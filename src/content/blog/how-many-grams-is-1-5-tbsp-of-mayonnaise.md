<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of mayonnaise weighs approximately 22.5 grams in the UK. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and cooking times. Whether you’re whipping up a quick sauce or coating chicken for a crispy finish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate mayonnaise measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of mayonnaise can make or break a dish, particularly in air fryer recipes where excess oil can lead to soggy results. For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken tenders</a>, 1.5 tbsp of mayonnaise (22.5g) provides just enough moisture without overwhelming the coating. Too little, and your chicken might dry out; too much, and it won’t crisp up properly.</p>  

<p>Mayonnaise density can vary slightly between brands, but 1.5 tbsp generally equates to 22.5 grams. If you’re working with a particularly thick or thin mayo, consider weighing it for absolute precision. A digital kitchen scale is a handy tool for this, ensuring your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversions</a> are spot-on.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 1.5 tbsp mayonnaise without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have scales handy, you can still measure 1.5 tbsp of mayonnaise accurately. Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it level for the first tablespoon, then add half for the remaining 0.5 tbsp. This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a>, where a light mayo coating enhances crispiness.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp mayonnaise in air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for binding breadcrumbs to fish fillets or creating a creamy dip for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potato wedges</a>. It’s also ideal for marinades, adding richness without making dishes greasy. Remember, air fryers circulate hot air efficiently, so a little mayo goes a long way.</p>  

<h2>Converting other mayonnaise amounts to grams</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for different quantities, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, and 3 tbsp = 45g. These conversions are useful when scaling recipes up or down, especially for batch cooking in your air fryer. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> bookmarked for easy access.</p>  

<p>For those who love experimenting, knowing these measurements helps when adapting traditional oven recipes for the air fryer. Whether you’re making crispy tofu or juicy turkey burgers, precise mayo measurements ensure perfect results every time.

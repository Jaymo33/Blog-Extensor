<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient quantities to deliver crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Using the correct weight for ingredients like double cream ensures your recipes aren't too runny or thick. For example, adding too much cream to a sauce could make it overly rich, while too little might leave it lacking in flavour. A digital kitchen scale is a great tool for measuring 1 tbsp of double cream in grams accurately.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially desserts like cakes or custards, require precise measurements of double cream. If you're adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, converting tablespoons to grams helps maintain consistency. This is particularly useful for UK cooks, as recipes often use volume measurements rather than weight.

<h3>How to measure double cream without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a scale, you can still measure 1 tbsp of double cream accurately. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15ml, which equates to roughly 15 grams for double cream. However, slight variations can occur depending on the cream's thickness. For best results, use a proper measuring spoon and level it off with a knife. This method works well for most air fryer recipes, from creamy pasta dishes to indulgent puddings.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for double cream in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Double cream is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, adding richness to both sweet and savoury dishes. It's perfect for making creamy sauces to accompany air-fried chicken or for creating decadent desserts like chocolate mousse.

<h3>Storing and handling double cream for best results</h3>  
<p>Double cream should always be stored in the refrigerator and used within its use-by date. When measuring 1 tbsp of double cream in grams, ensure it's at the right temperature - too cold and it might not pour accurately, too warm and it could spoil your measurements. For air fryer recipes, it's often best to let cream come to room temperature before use, unless the recipe specifies otherwise. This ensures even mixing and better texture in your finished dish.</p>

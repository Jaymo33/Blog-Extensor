<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of Nutella weigh approximately 37 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you’re baking Nutella-filled pastries or adding it to desserts, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-measuring.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient accuracy is crucial. Too much Nutella can cause spills or uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>Nutella-stuffed cookies</a>, 37 grams per 2 tbsp ensures the right balance.</p>  
<p>Using a digital scale is the easiest way to measure Nutella, as its thick texture can make spoon measurements inconsistent. If you don’t have one, levelling off your tablespoons with a knife helps.

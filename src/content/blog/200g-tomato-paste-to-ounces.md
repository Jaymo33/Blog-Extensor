<p>200g of tomato paste equals approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a quick pasta sauce or a hearty stew, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results. Too much tomato paste, for example, might make a dish overly thick or acidic. On the other hand, too little could leave it bland. By converting 200g of tomato paste to ounces accurately, you’ll achieve the perfect balance every time. This is especially useful for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken dishes</a>, where tomato paste is often used as a base for marinades.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so small measurement errors can have a big impact. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, knowing that 200g of tomato paste is roughly 7.05 ounces helps maintain consistency.

<h3>How to measure 200g of tomato paste without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 200g of tomato paste using tablespoons. One tablespoon of tomato paste weighs about 15g, so 200g would be roughly 13 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as using scales, so for best results, invest in a digital scale. It’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking, especially when working with sticky ingredients like tomato paste.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 200g of tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste is a versatile ingredient that adds depth to many air fryer dishes. From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> to meaty mains, 200g of tomato paste (or 7.05 ounces) can transform your cooking. It’s perfect for creating rich sauces, marinades, or even as a base for homemade ketchup. The concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way, so accurate measurements are key.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 200g of tomato paste is in air fryer-friendly stews or casseroles. The paste thickens the sauce and adds a robust tomato flavour.

This way, you’ll always have the right amount on hand for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

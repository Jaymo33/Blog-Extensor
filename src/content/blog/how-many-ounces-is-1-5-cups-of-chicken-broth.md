<p>1.5 cups of chicken broth equals 12 fluid ounces (or approximately 340 grams by weight). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you're preparing soups, stews, or marinades, knowing this conversion ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of liquid, like chicken broth, is crucial in air fryer recipes. Too much can make food soggy, while too little may dry it out. For example, when making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>delicious air fryer chicken dish</a>, 1.5 cups of chicken broth (12 oz) ensures even cooking and flavour infusion. Always measure liquids carefully to avoid inconsistencies.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so liquids evaporate faster than in conventional ovens. This means precise measurements, like converting 1.5 cups of chicken broth to ounces, help maintain the right moisture balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Chicken Broth</h3>  
<p>For accuracy, use a liquid measuring cup marked in ounces and cups. Fill it to the 1.5-cup line, which is also 12 fluid ounces. If you're using weight, 1.5 cups of chicken broth weighs roughly 340 grams. This method works for all recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> to hearty stews.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for marinating proteins or creating sauces. For instance, 1.5 cups (12 oz) of chicken broth can be used to baste a whole chicken in the air fryer, keeping it juicy. It’s also ideal for deglazing pans or making gravy. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> to see how broth enhances flavours.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in grain dishes like quinoa or rice, where 1.5 cups of broth adds depth. If you’re reheating leftovers, a splash of broth prevents dryness. For cleaning tips, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>maintaining your air fryer</a>.</p>

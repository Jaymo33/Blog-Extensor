<p>375 grams of rice equals approximately 1.9 cups in the UK or 2.2 cups in the US. Getting this measurement right is essential for perfectly cooked rice, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're meal prepping or whipping up a quick side dish, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Rice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Cooking rice in an air fryer requires precision to avoid undercooking or drying it out. Too much rice can overcrowd the basket, while too little may burn. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer rice dishes</a>, 375 grams is a common portion size. Using cups instead of scales? This conversion ensures you get it right every time.</p>  

<p>Different rice types—like basmati, jasmine, or brown rice—have slightly varying densities. That’s why weighing rice (or using a reliable conversion) is better than guessing. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, sticking to the recommended 375 grams guarantees ideal texture and flavour.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for 375 Grams of Rice</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of rice typically holds 200 grams, so 375 grams equals roughly 1.9 cups. In the US, a cup is smaller (about 175 grams), meaning 375 grams is closer to 2.2 cups. Always check where your recipe originates to avoid measurement mishaps.</p>  

<p>For air fryer cooking, slight adjustments might be needed based on your model’s capacity. Refer to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for other common weights. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fryer chicken and rice</a> or a vegetarian dish, accuracy ensures even cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 375 Grams of Rice Without Scales</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scales? Use the spoon-and-level method: lightly fill your cup with rice, then level it off with a knife. For 375 grams, you’d need just under 2 UK cups or slightly over 2 US cups. Remember, packed rice will yield more, so keep it loose for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting Cooking Times for 375 Grams of Rice</h2>  
<p>In an air fryer, 375 grams of rice usually cooks in 15–20 minutes at 180°C, depending on the type. Brown rice may need 5 extra minutes, while pre-soaked basmati cooks faster. Always fluff the rice halfway through for even results.</p>

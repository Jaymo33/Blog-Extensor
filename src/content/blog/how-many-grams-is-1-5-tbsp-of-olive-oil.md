<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of olive oil equals approximately 20 grams (g) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precision ensures crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Whether you’re drizzling oil over chips or coating chicken wings, knowing the exact weight helps avoid soggy or overly dry results.

<h2>Why accurate olive oil measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your food may stick or dry out; too much, and it can become greasy. Converting 1.5 tbsp of olive oil to grams ensures consistency, especially for recipes like roasted vegetables or crispy potatoes. Many air fryer enthusiasts rely on weight measurements for better accuracy than volume. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Olive oil is a staple in Mediterranean and British cooking, adding flavour and helping achieve that golden crispiness. For dishes like air-fried salmon or roasted mushrooms, 20g of oil (1.5 tbsp) is often the sweet spot. If you’re meal prepping, weighing ingredients saves time and reduces waste. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of olive oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 1.5 tbsp of olive oil accurately. A standard UK tablespoon holds about 15ml, so 1.5 tbsp equals roughly 22.5ml. Since olive oil weighs around 0.9g per ml, this translates to roughly 20g. For best results, use a measuring spoon and level it off. Need more air fryer hacks?

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of olive oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>From crispy chicken wings to golden roast potatoes, 1.5 tbsp (20g) of olive oil is a versatile measurement. It’s enough to coat a medium batch of vegetables or a couple of chicken fillets without overdoing it. For lighter dishes like air-fried cod or tofu, you might use slightly less. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on perfect oil ratios.</p>  

<p>If you’re cooking frozen foods like chips or onion rings, 1.5 tbsp of oil helps achieve that takeaway-style crunch. For desserts like air-fried cookies or cakes, olive oil can replace butter—just stick to the 20g equivalent. Want more tips? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a> has plenty of sweet inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Does olive oil type affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>Extra virgin, light, or blended olive oil all weigh roughly the same—about 0.9g per ml. So whether you’re using premium or budget oil, 1.5 tbsp will still be around 20g. However, flavoured oils (like garlic or chilli-infused) might have slight variations due to added ingredients. For consistent results, stick to plain olive oil in air fryer recipes.</p>

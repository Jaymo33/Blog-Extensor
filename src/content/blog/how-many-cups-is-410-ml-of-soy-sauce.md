<h2>How to Measure 410 ml of Soy Sauce</h2>
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use a standard cup to measure 410 ml of soy sauce. Fill the cup to just under the 2-cup mark, as 410 ml is slightly less than 2 cups. For more precise measurements, a liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings is ideal.</p>
<p>Pouring soy sauce can be messy, so use a funnel if transferring from a bottle to a measuring cup. For sticky sauces like soy, lightly greasing the measuring cup can help it slide out easily.

<h2>How to Measure 5g of Tomato Ketchup</h2>
<p>Measuring 5g of tomato ketchup can be tricky if you don't have a kitchen scale. One teaspoon of tomato ketchup weighs roughly 5g, which is about 0.18 ounces. This makes it easy to measure without a scale. If you're using a tablespoon, remember that one tablespoon holds about 15g, so you'd need roughly a third of a tablespoon to get 5g.</p>
<p>For those who prefer visual cues, 5g of tomato ketchup is roughly the size of a small grape. This can help you estimate if you're in a pinch. If you're preparing a larger batch, like for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potatoes</a>, you might need to scale up your measurements accordingly. Always double-check to ensure accuracy.</p>

<h3>Tools for Accurate Measurement</h3>
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 5g of tomato ketchup. These scales often allow you to switch between grams and ounces, making conversions a breeze. If you don't have a scale, measuring spoons can be a good alternative. Just remember that the viscosity of ketchup can affect the measurement, so level off your spoon for the best results.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 5g of Tomato Ketchup</h2>
<p>5g of tomato ketchup might seem like a small amount, but it's perfect for adding a hint of sweetness and tang to your dishes. It's often used in marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>air fryer beef</a> or as a dipping sauce for snacks. Because air fryers cook food quickly, a little ketchup can go a long way in enhancing flavour without overpowering the dish.</p>
<p>Another popular use is in glazes or sauces for air-fried meats or vegetables. Mixing 5g of tomato ketchup with other ingredients like soy sauce or honey can create a delicious coating.

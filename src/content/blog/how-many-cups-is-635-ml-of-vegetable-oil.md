<p>635 ml of vegetable oil equals approximately 2.68 cups in the US or 2.23 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking or frying, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vegetable oil in your air fryer is crucial for texture and flavour. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may leave it dry. Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so even small measurement errors can affect cooking times and results. For perfect dishes like crispy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or golden <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roasted potatoes</a>, precise oil quantities are key.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes specify oil in millilitres or cups, depending on their origin. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml – a difference that matters when converting 635 ml of vegetable oil. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps eliminate guesswork for international recipes.</p>

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements for 635 ml of Vegetable Oil</h3>  
<p>In the US, 635 ml converts to about 2.68 cups (635 ÷ 240). For UK cooks, it's roughly 2.23 cups (635 ÷ 284). This 0.45 cup difference shows why specifying your measurement system is vital. When following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, note whether they use metric or imperial measurements.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips for Measuring Vegetable Oil in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>For best results when converting 635 ml of vegetable oil to cups, use liquid measuring cups with clear markings. Pour slowly at eye level to ensure accuracy. If your recipe calls for "635ml vegetable oil in cups" but you only have measuring spoons, remember that 16 tablespoons make 1 US cup.</p>  
<p>When preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> or savoury dishes, consider the oil's viscosity. Vegetable oil pours differently than thicker oils, affecting measurement precision. For consistent results, measure 635 ml of vegetable oil at room temperature and level off the cup's surface.</p>

<h3>Converting 635 ml of Vegetable Oil for Different Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Some air fryer recipes may require adjusting the 635 ml vegetable oil quantity based on portion size. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes scaling options for various serving sizes. Remember that marinades and coatings may need different oil ratios than direct cooking methods.</p>

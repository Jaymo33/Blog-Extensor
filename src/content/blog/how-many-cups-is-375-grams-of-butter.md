<p>375 grams of butter is roughly equivalent to 1.6 cups (or 1 and 2/3 cups) when measured in standard US cups. For UK measurements, it’s closer to 1.5 cups due to slight differences in cup sizes. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a buttery dish in your air fryer, getting this conversion right ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When baking or cooking, especially in an air fryer, precision is key. Too much butter can make dishes greasy, while too little can leave them dry. For recipes like air-fried cookies or cakes, 375 grams of butter is a common measurement, so knowing its cup equivalent is essential. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for flawless cooking.</p>  

<p>Butter behaves differently in air fryers compared to conventional ovens. Since air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, excess butter can cause smoking or uneven cooking. Measuring 375 grams of butter correctly ensures your dishes come out golden and delicious. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 240ml, while a UK cup is 250ml. This means 375 grams of butter converts to about 1.6 US cups or 1.5 UK cups. For air fryer recipes, sticking to one standard avoids confusion. If you’re following a British recipe, double-check whether it uses UK or US measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 375 Grams of Butter Without Scales</h2>  
<p>Don’t have a kitchen scale? No problem. You can still measure 375 grams of butter using standard measuring cups. One stick of butter (in the US) is about 113 grams, so 375 grams equals roughly 3.3 sticks. Alternatively, use the displacement method: fill a measuring cup with water, add butter until the water rises to the 1.6-cup mark, and you’ve got your 375 grams.</p>  

<p>For air fryer cooking, pre-measured butter ensures even distribution. Whether you’re making crispy potatoes or buttery salmon, accurate measurements prevent mishaps. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using butter perfectly.</p>  

<h3>Converting Butter for Different Dishes</h3>  
<p>375 grams of butter works beautifully in cakes, cookies, and even savoury dishes like garlic bread. In an air fryer, butter helps achieve that golden crispiness without deep frying. For example, brushing 375 grams of melted butter on shrimp or vegetables before air frying enhances flavour and texture. Always measure carefully to avoid over-saturation.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Butter</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is using melted butter instead of solid butter for measurements. 375 grams of melted butter takes up more volume than solid butter, leading to inaccuracies. Always measure butter in its solid form unless the recipe specifies otherwise. Another mistake is packing butter into cups, which can add extra grams unintentionally.</p>  

<p>Air fryer cooking demands precision, so avoid eyeballing measurements. For cleaning tips after buttery air fryer sessions, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer spotless</a>. Proper maintenance ensures longevity and consistent performance.</p>  

<h3>Butter Substitutes in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of butter, alternatives like margarine, coconut oil, or olive oil can work. However, 375 grams of these substitutes may behave differently in an air fryer. Margarine, for instance, has higher water content, which can affect crispiness. For best results, stick to butter or check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for butter-free options.</p>

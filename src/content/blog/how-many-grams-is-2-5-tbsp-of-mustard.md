<h2>Why accurate mustard measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Mustard adds tang and depth to dishes, but too much or too little can throw off your recipe. In an air fryer, where heat circulates rapidly, balanced flavours are key. A precise 2.5 tbsp (37.5g) of mustard ensures your marinade coats evenly or your glaze caramelises just right. This is especially important for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, where mustard often features in the coating.</p>  

<p>Different mustard types (Dijon, English, whole grain) have slightly varying densities, but 37.5g is a reliable average. For thicker mustards, gently level off your tablespoon for consistency. If you’re scaling up a batch, multiply accordingly—5 tbsp would be 75g, and so on. Always measure after stirring, as mustard can separate.</p>  

<h3>Converting mustard for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for mustard by volume (tbsp), but weighing ingredients eliminates guesswork. A digital kitchen scale guarantees accuracy, especially for sticky ingredients like mustard. If your recipe lists 2.5 tbsp of mustard and you prefer grams, now you know it’s 37.5g. This precision is handy for meal preppers doubling recipes found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 tbsp of mustard</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for glazing salmon fillets or coating chicken wings before air frying. It’s also ideal for mixing into burger patties or creating a quick honey-mustard dip. For vegetarian options, try it in a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>air fryer tofu</a>—the mustard helps the seasoning cling beautifully.</p>  

<p>Mustard’s acidity also tenderises meats during cooking. When combined with herbs and oil, 37.5g of mustard makes enough marinade for 4-6 chicken thighs. Remember to clean your air fryer basket afterward—sticky mustard residues need proper scrubbing.

<h3>Measuring without scales</h3>  
<p>No scales? A UK tablespoon holds 15ml, so 2.5 tbsp is 37.5ml. Mustard’s density means this volume roughly equals 37.5g. Use proper measuring spoons (not tableware) for accuracy. Fill the spoon, then level it with a knife for consistent results every time.</p>

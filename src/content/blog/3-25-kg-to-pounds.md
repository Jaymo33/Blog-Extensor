<h3>Converting 3.25 kg to pounds and ounces</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you need more precision than just pounds, especially for baking or delicate recipes. To convert 3.25 kg to pounds and ounces, first find the total pounds (7.165), then multiply the decimal part (0.165) by 16 to get ounces.

<h3>How 3.25 kg converts to stones and pounds</h3>
<p>In the UK, people often use stones and pounds for body weight, but it can also come up in cooking contexts. To convert 3.25 kg to stones and pounds, first convert to pounds (7.165), then divide by 14 to find stones.

While not common in recipes, this conversion might be useful for understanding larger weight references or when comparing portion sizes.

<p>1.25 cups of lemon juice equals 10 fluid ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a tangy marinade or a zesty dessert, knowing the exact ounces ensures consistency and flavour balance.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver perfect results. Too much or too little lemon juice can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, a marinade with 1.25 cups of lemon juice (10 ounces) will have a sharper tang compared to one with less. This is especially important for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lemon chicken</a> or citrus-glazed salmon.</p>
<p>Using the correct amount of lemon juice also affects cooking times. Excess liquid can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too little might dry out your food. Always measure carefully to avoid these pitfalls and achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>

<h2>How to Convert Cups to Ounces for Lemon Juice</h2>
<p>Converting 1.25 cups of lemon juice to ounces is straightforward. One cup of lemon juice equals 8 fluid ounces, so 1.25 cups is 10 ounces. This conversion works for both fresh-squeezed and bottled lemon juice, though fresh juice often has a brighter flavour. If you're using a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>, you'll find this measurement consistent across most recipes.</p>
<p>For those who prefer weight measurements, 10 fluid ounces of lemon juice weighs approximately 284 grams. This can be useful if you're scaling recipes up or down. Remember, accuracy is key when working with acidic ingredients like lemon juice, as they interact with other components in your dish.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Lemon Juice</h3>
<p>Always use a liquid measuring cup for lemon juice, not a dry one. Tilt the cup at eye level to ensure you've reached the 1.25-cup (10-ounce) mark. If your recipe calls for tablespoons, note that 10 ounces equals 20 tablespoons. For more precise measurements, consider using a kitchen scale set to fluid ounces.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 1.25 Cups of Lemon Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>1.25 cups of lemon juice (10 ounces) is a versatile quantity for many air fryer dishes. It's perfect for marinating proteins like chicken or fish, where the acid helps tenderise the meat. Try it in a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lemon-herb chicken</a> recipe for a bright, fresh flavour. The same amount works well in citrus-based sauces or dressings for air-fried vegetables.</p>
<p>You can also use 1.25 cups of lemon juice in desserts like air-fried lemon cakes or tarts. The acidity balances the sweetness and adds a refreshing zing. Just be sure to adjust other liquid ingredients accordingly to maintain the right batter consistency. For cleaning your air fryer, a mixture of lemon juice and water works wonders â€“ check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Lemon Juice</h3>
<p>If you have leftover lemon juice from your 1.25-cup measurement, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for future use. This way, you'll always have lemon juice on hand for spontaneous <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>air fryer recipes</a> without worrying about waste.</p>

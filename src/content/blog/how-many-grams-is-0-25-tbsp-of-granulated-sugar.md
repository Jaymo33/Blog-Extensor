<p>0.25 tbsp of granulated sugar equals approximately 3.125 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where exact measurements can make all the difference.

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>
<p>When cooking or baking in an air fryer, precise measurements are crucial for achieving the right texture and flavour. Too much sugar can lead to overly sweet or burnt results, while too little might leave your dish lacking. Granulated sugar is a common ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from cakes to glazes, so getting the measurement right is key.</p>

<h3>Converting other sugar measurements</h3>

<h2>Using granulated sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Granulated sugar is versatile in air fryer cooking. It's not just for sweet dishes - a sprinkle can help caramelise vegetables or add crunch to roasted nuts. When using sugar in your air fryer, remember that it can melt and stick, so always line your basket with parchment or use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> for easy maintenance.</p>

Whether you're making air fryer doughnuts or fruit crumbles, knowing that 0.25 tbsp equals 3.125 grams helps you achieve consistent results. This precision is especially important when working with small batches.</p>

<h3>Tips for working with sugar in air fryers</h3>
<p>When using granulated sugar in your air fryer, keep the temperature moderate to prevent burning. Sugar caramelises at around 160Â°C, so many recipes work best at this temperature. Always preheat your air fryer for even cooking, and shake the basket occasionally for uniform results.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 0.25 tbsp of granulated sugar</h2>
<p>While 3.125 grams might seem like a small amount, it's perfect for adjusting sweetness in single-serving dishes. You might use this quantity to sweeten a morning smoothie, dust over fresh fruit, or add to a rub for meats. The air fryer's concentrated heat means a little sugar goes a long way in creating delicious caramelisation.</p>

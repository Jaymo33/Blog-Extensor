<p>Olive oil is a staple in many kitchens, and its weight can vary slightly depending on factors like temperature and brand.

Keeping a kitchen scale handy can help you measure precisely, especially for air fryer recipes where every gram counts.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of olive oil without scales</h3>

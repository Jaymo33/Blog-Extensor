<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if the ingredients are measured correctly. Too much or too little soft cheese can throw off the texture of your dish.

<p>Soft cheese, like cream cheese or ricotta, is a staple in many air fryer recipes. Whether you're making a dessert or a savoury dish, knowing that 250g equals 8.82 ounces helps avoid guesswork. This is especially handy for UK cooks who might be used to metric measurements but need to follow an imperial recipe.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 250g of soft cheese</h3>  
<p>From creamy pasta bakes to air-fried stuffed peppers, 250g of soft cheese is a versatile ingredient. It’s the perfect amount for a family-sized portion, ensuring everyone gets a taste.

<h2>How to measure soft cheese without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, 250g of soft cheese is roughly one standard UK tub. Most brands sell soft cheese in 250g portions, making it easy to measure.

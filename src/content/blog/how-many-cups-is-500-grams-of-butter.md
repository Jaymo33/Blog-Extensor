<p>500 grams of butter is approximately 2.2 cups in the UK and 2.1 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or savoury dishes, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistent results. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Understanding Butter Measurements</h2>  
<p>Butter is a staple in many recipes, but its measurement can vary depending on where you live. In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, making 500 grams equal to two blocks. In the US, butter is typically measured in cups or sticks, with one stick being about 113 grams. This means 500 grams of butter is roughly 4.4 sticks or just over 2 cups. If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements are key to achieving the perfect texture and flavour.</p>  

<p>When converting 500 grams of butter to cups, it's important to consider whether you're using the metric or imperial system. The slight difference between UK and US cup sizes can affect your recipe. For example, a UK cup is 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. This might seem minor, but it can make a difference in delicate bakes like souffl√©s or pastries. Always double-check your measurements, especially when trying new recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Baking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, so precise measurements are crucial. Too much butter can lead to greasy results, while too little might leave your bake dry. If you're converting 500 grams of butter to cups for an air fryer recipe, use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer bakes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting 500 Grams of Butter for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or savoury dishes, 500 grams of butter is a common measurement. For cookies, 500 grams of butter (about 2.1 US cups) will yield a rich, buttery dough. For cakes, this amount ensures a moist crumb and tender texture. If you're preparing a savoury dish like garlic bread in your air fryer, 500 grams of butter will generously coat several loaves.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 500 grams of butter is roughly equivalent to 2.2 UK cups or 2.1 US cups. This conversion is handy when adapting recipes from international sources. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, which often feature butter as a key ingredient.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Butter Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 500 grams of butter using cup measurements. One UK cup of butter is about 227 grams, so 500 grams is just over 2 cups. In the US, one cup is roughly 226 grams, making 500 grams about 2.1 cups. For best results, pack the butter firmly into the measuring cup and level it off with a knife.

<h2>Understanding Butter Measurements</h2>  
<p>Butter is a staple in many recipes, but its measurement can vary depending on where you live. In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, making 500 grams equal to two blocks. In the US, butter is typically measured in cups or sticks, with one stick being about 113 grams. This means 500 grams of butter is roughly 4.4 sticks or just over 2 cups. If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements are key to achieving the perfect texture and flavour.</p>  

<p>When converting 500 grams of butter to cups, it's important to consider whether you're using the metric or imperial system. The slight difference between UK and US cup sizes can affect your recipe. For example, a UK cup is 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. This might seem minor, but it can make a difference in delicate bakes like souffl√©s or pastries.

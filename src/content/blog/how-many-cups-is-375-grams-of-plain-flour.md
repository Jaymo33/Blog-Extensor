<p>375 grams of plain flour is roughly equivalent to 3 cups. However, measuring flour by weight (grams) is far more accurate than using cups, as scooping methods can vary. If you're baking in your air fryer, precision is key—especially for cakes, cookies, and bread. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend weighing ingredients for consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Measuring Flour Accurately Matters</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can affect texture and rise. Too much flour can make cakes dense, while too little can cause them to collapse. If you're using an air fryer, uneven heat distribution means precise ratios are even more crucial. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for ensuring accuracy, but if you only have cups, fluff the flour first before scooping.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, like those found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, slight variations can impact cooking times. Whether you're making air fryer cookies or bread, 375 grams of plain flour should give you the perfect structure. Always level off your cups with a knife for the closest approximation.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>Did you know a UK cup (250ml) differs slightly from a US cup (240ml)? For 375 grams of plain flour, this means about 3 UK cups or just over 3 US cups. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>, double-check which standard it uses. Most UK bakers stick to metric weights, but if you're adapting an American recipe, adjust accordingly.</p>  

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>While 375 grams of plain flour equals roughly 3 cups, factors like humidity and packing density can alter this. Sifted flour will take up more volume, while compacted flour may weigh more per cup. For air fryer baking—where space is limited—getting the right consistency ensures even cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for foolproof measurements.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that ratios matter. For example, 375 grams of plain flour might pair with 200 grams of sugar and 2 eggs in a standard sponge. Air fryer batters should be slightly thicker to prevent dripping, so measure carefully. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, but if you're using cups, fluff, spoon, and level for the best results.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Flour</h3>  
<p>Scooping flour directly from the bag packs it down, leading to excess. Instead, use a spoon to lightly fill the cup, then level it off. Another mistake? Ignoring recipe origins—375 grams of plain flour in a British recipe assumes UK cups, while American recipes may differ. For air fryer cooking, consistency is everything, so when in doubt, weigh it out.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1.0 UK cup is 284 ml, most recipes (including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>) use the US standard of 240 ml per cup. Always check which measurement system your recipe follows to avoid errors. This is especially crucial for air fryer baking, where precision affects rising and browning.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Coconut Milk Correctly</h2>  
<p>Coconut milk can separate, so always stir it well before measuring. For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup on a flat surface. If you're using canned coconut milk, shake the tin vigorously or whisk it to blend the cream and liquid.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, slightly thicker coconut milk works better for coatings or marinades, while thinner versions are ideal for sauces. Explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> that use coconut milk for luscious, dairy-free treats.</p>

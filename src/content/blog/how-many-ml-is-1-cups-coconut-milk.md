<p>1.0 cups of coconut milk equals approximately 240 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures even cooking and perfect textures. Whether you're making curries, desserts, or sauces, knowing the exact ml measurement helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut milk can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your recipe might turn out dry; too much, and it could become soggy. Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so liquid ratios must be spot-on. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like creamy curries or coconut-based desserts, call for coconut milk. If you're adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, converting cups to ml ensures consistency. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for inspiration on dishes that use coconut milk perfectly.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1.0 UK cup is 284 ml, most recipes (including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>) use the US standard of 240 ml per cup. Always check which measurement system your recipe follows to avoid errors. This is especially crucial for air fryer baking, where precision affects rising and browning.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Coconut Milk Correctly</h2>  
<p>Coconut milk can separate, so always stir it well before measuring. For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup on a flat surface. If you're using canned coconut milk, shake the tin vigorously or whisk it to blend the cream and liquid.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, slightly thicker coconut milk works better for coatings or marinades, while thinner versions are ideal for sauces. Explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> that use coconut milk for luscious, dairy-free treats.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Coconut Milk Quantities</h3>  
<p>Need to scale your recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 0.5 cups = 120 ml, 2 cups = 480 ml, and so on. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a> to keep your air fryer in top shape after cooking with coconut milk, which can leave oily residues.</p>

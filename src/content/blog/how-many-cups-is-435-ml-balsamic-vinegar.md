    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "In an air fryer, balsamic vinegar reduces and caramelises faster due to the concentrated heat and airflow. This creates a thicker, more intense glaze or marinade. However, it can also burn more easily, so keep an eye on cooking times and consider diluting it slightly if needed."

    "text": "Store leftover balsamic vinegar in a cool, dark place, ideally in its original bottle or a glass container with a tight seal. Properly stored, it can last for years, though its flavour may mellow over time. Avoid refrigeration, as it can cause condensation and dilute the vinegar."

<p>435 ml of balsamic vinegar is approximately 1.84 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer, as precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up a glaze for salmon or a marinade for chicken, knowing how many cups 435 ml of balsamic vinegar equals ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>When using an air fryer, ingredients like balsamic vinegar need to be measured precisely to avoid overly soggy or dry results. Too much liquid can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. That’s why converting 435 ml of balsamic vinegar to cups (1.84 cups) is so important for air fryer recipes.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 435 ml of Balsamic Vinegar Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup handy? No problem. You can still measure 435 ml of balsamic vinegar using common kitchen items. A standard UK mug holds about 284 ml, so 435 ml would be roughly one and a half mugs. Alternatively, use tablespoons—20 tablespoons equal approximately 300 ml, so you’d need around 29 tablespoons for 435 ml.</p>

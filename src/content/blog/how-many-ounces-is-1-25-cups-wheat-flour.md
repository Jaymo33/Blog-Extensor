    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Over-measuring flour is a common cause. If you packed 1.25 cups instead of spooning lightly, you might have used 6+ ounces instead of 5.3. Also, air fryers dehydrate foods faster – try reducing cook time by 10% or adding an extra tablespoon of liquid to balance the flour."

<p>1.25 cups of wheat flour equals approximately 5.3 ounces (150 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you’re whipping up air fryer cakes or bread, knowing the exact weight of your ingredients makes all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on rapid hot air circulation, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on to avoid dry or dense results. Using 1.25 cups of wheat flour without converting to ounces can lead to inconsistencies, especially in delicate recipes like air fryer cookies or muffins. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we always recommend weighing flour for reliability. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common baking measurements.</p>  

<p>Different types of flour (whole wheat, plain, self-raising) have slightly varying densities, but 1.25 cups of standard wheat flour consistently weighs around 5.3 ounces. For best results, fluff the flour with a fork before scooping and leveling off the measuring cup. This prevents compacting, which could add extra ounces unintentionally.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.25 cups of wheat flour without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, use the spoon-and-level method for 1.25 cups of wheat flour. Gently spoon flour into your measuring cup until slightly heaped, then level with a straight edge. Avoid tapping or shaking the cup, as this compacts the flour and skews the ounce conversion. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 1.25 cups wheat flour</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer favourites call for around 1.25 cups (5.3 ounces) of wheat flour. This includes small-batch air fryer banana bread, scones, or even homemade doughnuts. The confined space of an air fryer basket means recipes often require less volume than traditional oven baking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a> features several recipes using this measurement.</p>  

<p>When adapting conventional recipes for your air fryer, reducing quantities is often necessary. Converting 1.25 cups of wheat flour to ounces helps maintain the correct flour-to-liquid ratio in smaller batches. Remember that air fryers cook faster, so precise measurements prevent over-drying or undercooking.</p>  

<h3>Converting other flour amounts for air fryer use</h3>  
<p>Once you’ve mastered 1.25 cups wheat flour to ounces (5.3 oz), you can scale up or down. Half a cup is about 2.1 ounces, while 2 cups equal roughly 8.5 ounces. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick reference during recipe adjustments. Proper measurements ensure your air fryer creations turn out light, fluffy, and perfectly cooked every time.</p>

<p>0.33 cup of apple juice equals approximately 2.64 fluid ounces (fl oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where exact liquid measurements can impact texture and cooking times. Whether you're making a glaze, marinade, or a refreshing drink, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on rapid air circulation to cook food evenly, and liquids like apple juice can affect moisture levels. Using the correct amount ensures your dishes aren’t too dry or soggy. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>glaze for air fryer chicken</a> might call for 0.33 cup of apple juice, and knowing it’s 2.64 oz helps avoid guesswork. Precise measurements also matter when scaling recipes up or down for meal prep.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, require small liquid quantities. A slight overpour could alter the dish’s consistency. If you’re adapting a traditional oven recipe for the air fryer, converting cups to ounces ensures you maintain the intended flavour and texture. Always measure liquids at eye level for accuracy.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.33 cup of apple juice without a measuring cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Since 0.33 cup is roughly 2.64 oz, you can weigh the juice directly. Alternatively, tablespoons can help—0.33 cup equals about 5.28 tablespoons (since 1 cup = 16 tbsp). For sticky liquids like apple juice, lightly coat the spoon with oil to ensure it slides off easily.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.33 cup of apple juice in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Apple juice adds sweetness and moisture to many dishes. A <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>0.33 cup (2.64 oz)</a> portion works well in marinades for pork or glazes for roasted vegetables. It’s also great for deglazing pans or adding to sauces. In baking, it can replace sugar or syrup in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, keeping them moist without excess oil.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, try brushing 0.33 cup of apple juice on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a> during the last few minutes of cooking. The sugars caramelise, creating a sticky, flavourful coating. If you’re reheating leftovers, a splash of apple juice (about 0.33 cup) can revive dried-out meats or veggies.</p>  

<h3>Converting other cup measurements to ounces</h3>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 0.25 cup = 2 oz, 0.5 cup = 4 oz, and 1 cup = 8 oz. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for easy access. Remember, UK fluid ounces differ slightly from US measurements, so always double-check if using international recipes.</p>

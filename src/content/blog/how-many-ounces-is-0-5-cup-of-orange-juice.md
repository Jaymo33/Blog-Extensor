    "@type": "Answer",

<p>0.5 cup of orange juice equals 4 fluid ounces (fl oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your marinades, glazes, and sauces have the perfect consistency. Whether you’re preparing a citrusy chicken dish or a tangy dessert, knowing how many ounces are in 0.5 cup of orange juice helps you achieve consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Precision is key when cooking with an air fryer, as the compact cooking space requires balanced moisture levels. Using 0.5 cup of orange juice (4 fl oz) ensures your recipes aren’t too dry or soggy. For example, a marinade with the right amount of orange juice will caramelise beautifully, while too much could make your food steam instead of crisp. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like citrus-glazed salmon or orange-infused chicken, rely on precise liquid measurements. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, converting 0.5 cup of orange juice to ounces (4 fl oz) ensures the dish cooks evenly. Overloading with liquid can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes collection</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 0.5 Cup of Orange Juice Correctly</h2>
<p>To measure 0.5 cup of orange juice accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Fill it to the 4 fl oz line for the perfect amount. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a standard UK tablespoon holds 0.5 fl oz, so 8 tablespoons will give you 0.5 cup (4 fl oz) of orange juice. This method works well for small batches of marinades or glazes.</p>

<h3>Using Weight vs. Volume for Orange Juice</h3>
<p>While 0.5 cup of orange juice is 4 fl oz by volume, its weight can vary slightly depending on pulp content. On average, 0.5 cup weighs around 120 grams. For recipes requiring precision, like air fryer cakes or glazes, weighing ingredients can be more reliable. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often include weight measurements for best results.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 0.5 Cup of Orange Juice</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 0.5 cup of orange juice, such as orange-glazed chicken wings or citrus-marinated shrimp. The 4 fl oz measurement is ideal for creating a balanced flavour without overpowering the dish. For a quick weeknight meal, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>orange chicken recipe</a>, which uses this exact amount for a perfect glaze.</p>
<p>Orange juice also works wonders in vegetarian air fryer dishes. A 0.5 cup (4 fl oz) can brighten up tofu marinades or vegetable stir-fries. The acidity helps tenderise ingredients while adding a refreshing zing.

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Orange Juice Concentrations</h3>
<p>If using concentrated orange juice, adjust the 0.5 cup measurement accordingly. Dilute according to package instructions before measuring out your 4 fl oz. Freshly squeezed orange juice may vary in sweetness, so taste your mixture before adding it to recipes. This ensures your air fryer dishes have consistent flavour every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

<h3>Converting cups to ounces for tartar sauce</h3>

<h2>Tips for measuring tartar sauce in your air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>When working with 1.33 cups (10.64 oz) of tartar sauce in air fryer cooking, use a measuring jug with clear markings for liquids. For thicker applications like coatings, a kitchen scale provides the most accurate 1.33 cups to ounces conversion. Always level off the sauce in your measuring cup for consistency across batches.

<p>Consider the sauce's density when converting 1.33 cups of tartar sauce to ounces - chunky versions with pickles may weigh slightly more. For breaded air fryer dishes, aim for an even 10.64-ounce distribution to prevent sogginess. If scaling recipes, maintain the 1.33 cups to 10.64 ounces ratio for balanced flavours. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a> demonstrate ideal tartar sauce measurements.</p>

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring tartar sauce</h3>  
<p>Avoid packing tartar sauce into the measuring cup when converting 1.33 cups to ounces (10.64 oz). Gently spoon it in and level with a straight edge for accuracy. Don't confuse fluid ounces with weight ounces - for tartar sauce, they're nearly equivalent but this isn't true for all ingredients. Always use the same measurement method (cups or ounces) throughout a recipe for consistency.</p>

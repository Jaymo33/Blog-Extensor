<p>1.75 cups of sunflower seeds equals approximately 7.5 ounces in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise ingredient quantities for perfect results every time. Whether you're roasting sunflower seeds in your air fryer or adding them to a dish, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate measurements to elevate your cooking.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of sunflower seeds ensures even cooking and optimal flavour. Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Too many sunflower seeds can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven roasting. Too few might leave your dish lacking texture. That’s why converting 1.75 cups of sunflower seeds to ounces is so important. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Sunflower seeds are a versatile ingredient, perfect for snacks, salads, or as a crunchy topping. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or experimenting, knowing the weight ensures success. For example, 1.75 cups of sunflower seeds (7.5 oz) roasted in an air fryer at 180°C for 8-10 minutes makes a delicious, healthy snack.</p>  

<h2>How to measure sunflower seeds for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Measuring sunflower seeds by weight (ounces) is more accurate than using cups, as volume can vary. If you don’t have a kitchen scale, fluff the seeds in the container before lightly spooning them into a measuring cup. Avoid packing them down, as this can lead to an incorrect measurement. For 1.75 cups of sunflower seeds, aim for 7.5 ounces for the best results in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for sunflower seeds in air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>Sunflower seeds add crunch and nutrition to many dishes. Try them in air-fried granola, as a coating for chicken or fish, or mixed into veggie burgers. Their high oil content means they crisp up beautifully in the air fryer. For recipe inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable category</a>, where sunflower seeds often feature as a tasty addition.</p>  

<h2>Converting other measurements for sunflower seeds</h2>  
<p>If a recipe calls for grams instead of ounces, 1.75 cups (7.5 oz) of sunflower seeds equals roughly 212 grams. This conversion is handy for international recipes or if your scale measures in grams. Keeping a conversion chart or calculator nearby, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, simplifies the process. Remember, accuracy ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Storing and cleaning after using sunflower seeds</h3>  
<p>After roasting sunflower seeds in your air fryer, let the basket cool before cleaning. Sunflower seed shells can sometimes stick, so a quick wipe with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> keeps your appliance in top condition. Store unused seeds in an airtight container to maintain freshness for future recipes.</p>

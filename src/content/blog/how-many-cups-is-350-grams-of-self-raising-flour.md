<p>350 grams of self-raising flour equals approximately 2.8 cups in UK measurements or 2.5 cups in US measurements. Getting this conversion right is crucial for baking success, especially when using an air fryer where precise ingredient ratios matter. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or bread, knowing how to measure 350g of self-raising flour in cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Self-Raising Flour Measurements</h2>  
<p>Self-raising flour is a staple in British baking, containing baking powder for a light, fluffy texture. When converting 350 grams of self-raising flour to cups, it's essential to consider regional differences. In the UK, 1 cup of self-raising flour typically weighs 125 grams, meaning 350 grams equals roughly 2.8 cups. Meanwhile, US cups are slightly larger at 140 grams per cup, making 350 grams approximately 2.5 cups.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, accuracy matters more than ever due to the appliance's rapid cooking method. A slight variation in flour quantity can affect texture and rise. That's why we recommend using digital scales for precision, but if you only have cups, our conversion chart at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a> can help.</p>  

<h3>Why 350 Grams Is a Common Measurement</h3>  
<p>Many classic British recipes call for 350 grams of self-raising flour - the perfect amount for an 8-inch cake or 12 muffins. This quantity ensures proper structure while allowing the baking powder to work effectively. When adapting these recipes for your air fryer, maintaining the 350g flour ratio guarantees the right consistency for even cooking.</p>  

<h2>Converting 350g Self-Raising Flour for Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers require slightly adjusted measurements compared to conventional ovens. The intense circulating heat means batters made with 350 grams of self-raising flour may need a touch more liquid. We've found adding an extra tablespoon of milk or water helps compensate for the air fryer's drying effect when working with this flour quantity.</p>

The conversion from grams to cups remains the same, but cooking times and temperatures differ significantly from traditional baking methods.</p>  

<h3>Measuring Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't own kitchen scales, the spoon-and-level method works for measuring 350 grams of self-raising flour in cups. Gently spoon flour into your measuring cup without packing it down, then level off the excess with a straight edge. Remember, 350g equals about 2.8 UK cups or 2.5 US cups when measured this way.</p>  

<h2>Regional Differences in Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>British and American cup measurements vary slightly, which affects how 350 grams of self-raising flour converts. UK cups hold 250ml volume, while US cups are 240ml. This small difference means 350g translates to fewer US cups. Always check where your recipe originates when converting 350 grams self-raising flour to cups.</p>  

<p>Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Cakes>cake recipes</a> specify both gram and cup measurements for clarity. This is particularly helpful when scaling recipes up or down while maintaining the perfect 350g self-raising flour ratio for consistent results in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Storing Self-Raising Flour Properly</h3>  
<p>To maintain the effectiveness of your 350 grams of self-raising flour, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. The baking powder in self-raising flour loses potency over time, which could affect recipes where precise measurement matters. For best results, use within 3 months of opening.</p>  

<h2>Troubleshooting Common Measurement Issues</h2>  
<p>If your air fryer baked goods made with 350 grams of self-raising flour turn out dense, you might be packing the flour into cups too tightly. Always fluff the flour first before measuring. Alternatively, your self-raising flour might have lost its raising power - test it by mixing a spoonful with hot water; it should bubble vigorously.</p>

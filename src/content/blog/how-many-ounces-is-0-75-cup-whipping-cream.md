<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver even cooking and perfect textures.

<h3>How to measure 0.75 cup of whipping cream accurately</h3>  
<p>For the best results, use a liquid measuring cup for whipping cream. Fill it to the 0.75 cup mark, or weigh it on a kitchen scale for 6 ounces.

<p>25 grams of margarine equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and flavour. Whether you’re whipping up crispy roast potatoes or a moist cake, knowing how to convert grams to ounces helps you follow recipes accurately.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking or dry results.

Even a slight deviation can affect the final texture, making conversions like 25g margarine to ounces crucial.</p>

<h3>How to measure 25g of margarine without scales</h3>

It’s also perfect for buttery glazes on salmon or chicken.</p>

<h2>Why accurate coconut oil measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of coconut oil in your air fryer recipes ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Too little oil, and your food may dry out; too much, and it can become greasy.

Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Coconut oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and subtle flavour. Unlike butter, it won’t burn easily, making it ideal for high-heat cooking. Whether you’re following a recipe from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> or experimenting with your own creations, precise measurements like 0.75 tbsp to grams are key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.75 tbsp of coconut oil</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a tablespoon measure, you can use a teaspoon – 0.75 tbsp is equivalent to 2.25 tsp. For even greater accuracy, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend. Simply tare your scale, add coconut oil until it reads 10.5 grams, and you’re good to go. This method is especially useful for sticky ingredients like coconut oil that can be tricky to measure by volume.</p>  

<h2>Converting coconut oil for different recipes</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, call for coconut oil. Whether you’re making vegan cookies or granola clusters, knowing that 0.75 tbsp equals 10.5 grams helps maintain recipe integrity. This conversion works for both refined and unrefined coconut oil, though their flavours differ slightly.</p>  

<p>When substituting coconut oil for other fats in air fryer recipes, weight measurements are more reliable than volume. For example, if a recipe calls for 15g of butter, you’d need about 1.07 tbsp of coconut oil instead. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> also explains how to handle oil residues after cooking.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 0.75 tbsp coconut oil in air frying</h3>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for lightly coating vegetables before air frying – try it with Brussels sprouts or cauliflower. It’s also ideal for greasing air fryer baskets to prevent sticking without overdoing it. For crispier results, combine 10.5g coconut oil with your favourite seasonings before tossing with ingredients.</p>

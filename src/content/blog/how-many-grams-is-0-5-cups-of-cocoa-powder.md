<p>0.5 cups of cocoa powder equals approximately 50 grams, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you’re baking a chocolate cake or preparing a rich dessert, precise measurements ensure consistent results.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of cocoa powder is crucial for achieving the perfect texture and flavour in your air fryer recipes. Too much or too little can affect the rise, moisture, and overall taste of your baked goods. For example, a chocolate cake made with 0.5 cups of cocoa powder (50 grams) will have a balanced richness, while an incorrect measurement could result in a dry or overly dense texture. Precision is key, especially when working with air fryers, which cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens.</p>

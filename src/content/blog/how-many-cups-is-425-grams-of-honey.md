<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Honey is a staple in many recipes, from marinades to baked goods, and its thickness means small measurement errors can lead to big differences. Too much honey can make a dish overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave it lacking flavour. In air frying, where heat distribution is key, precise honey measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're making honey-glazed salmon or sticky tofu, getting the ratio right is crucial.</p>
<p>For those who love experimenting in the kitchen, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> offers plenty of inspiration. From sweet to savoury, honey plays a versatile role in air fryer cooking, and knowing how to measure it correctly opens up a world of culinary possibilities.</p>

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Honey</h2>
<p>It's important to note that US and UK cup sizes differ slightly, which affects how 425 grams of honey converts. In the US, a standard cup is 240ml, while in the UK, it's 250ml. This means 425 grams of honey equals roughly 1.25 US cups or 1.5 UK cups. For air fryer recipes, especially those from international sources, double-check which measurement system is being used to avoid mishaps.</p>
<p>If you're adapting a traditional oven recipe for the air fryer, precise conversions like these are even more critical. Air fryers cook faster and more intensely, so imbalances in ingredients like honey can lead to burning or uneven results. Always measure carefully and adjust as needed.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Honey Accurately</h3>
<p>Honey's sticky nature makes it tricky to measure. To get an exact 425 grams, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil or spray to help the honey slide out easily. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale for the most precise measurement.

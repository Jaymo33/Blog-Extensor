<h2>Tips for cooking a 0.5 kg lamb leg in the air fryer</h2>
<p>Cooking a 0.5 kg lamb leg in the air fryer is a fantastic way to enjoy a tender, flavourful roast with minimal effort. Given that 0.5 kg lamb leg is roughly 1.1 pounds, preheat your air fryer to 200°C for a crispy exterior. Season the lamb generously with rosemary, garlic, and olive oil, then place it in the basket. Cook for about 20-25 minutes, turning halfway, until the internal temperature reaches 60°C for medium-rare. Let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing to retain juices.</p>
<p>This size is ideal for two people and cooks quickly, making it a great weeknight option. Since air fryers circulate hot air, you get even browning without needing much oil. Remember that cooking times may vary slightly based on your air fryer model and the lamb’s thickness. Always use a meat thermometer to check doneness, especially when converting weights like 0.5 kg lamb leg to pounds for timing guides.

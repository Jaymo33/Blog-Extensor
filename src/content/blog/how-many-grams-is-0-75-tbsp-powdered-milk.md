<p>0.75 tbsp of powdered milk equals approximately 5.6 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, whether you're baking cakes or preparing sauces. Powdered milk is a versatile ingredient, and knowing its weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why measure powdered milk in grams?</h2>  
<p>Measuring powdered milk in grams is far more accurate than using tablespoons, especially for air fryer recipes. Air fryers cook food quickly, and slight measurement errors can affect texture and taste. For example, too much powdered milk in a cake batter can make it dense, while too little might leave it dry.</p>  
<p>Using a digital scale removes guesswork. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, converting tablespoons to grams ensures you get it right. This is particularly useful for recipes like air-fried cookies or custards where powdered milk adds richness.</p>  

<h3>How to convert 0.75 tbsp powdered milk to grams</h3>  
<p>The density of powdered milk affects its weight. On average, 1 tbsp of powdered milk weighs about 7.5 grams, so 0.75 tbsp is roughly 5.6 grams. For best results, use a kitchen scale to confirm. If you don’t have one, fluff the powdered milk with a fork before lightly spooning it into the tablespoon.</p>  

<h2>Using powdered milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Powdered milk is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy coatings to baked goods. It’s shelf-stable and easy to measure, making it ideal for meal prep. For example, you can use it in the breading for air-fried chicken or mix it into dough for air-fryer biscuits.</p>  
<p>Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for other common measurements. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a fluffy cake, precise measurements ensure success. Powdered milk also works well in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, adding a subtle richness without extra liquid.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring powdered milk</h3>  
<p>One mistake is packing the powdered milk into the tablespoon, which can lead to using almost double the required amount. Always spoon it lightly and level it off. Another error is not sifting powdered milk, which can cause clumps in batters or coatings.</p>  

<h2>Alternative uses for powdered milk</h2>  
<p>Beyond baking, powdered milk can enhance savory dishes in your air fryer. Mix it with spices for a crispy coating on tofu or vegetables. It’s also great for making instant sauces or gravies, especially in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> where convenience is key.</p>  
<p>For cleaning tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our guide</a> to keep your air fryer in top condition. Powdered milk can even be used in homemade air fryer liners to prevent sticking, though always check compatibility with your model.</p>  

<h3>Storing powdered milk for longevity</h3>  
<p>Keep powdered milk in an airtight container in a cool, dark place to prevent clumping. If you use it frequently, label the container with the weight conversions for quick reference. This saves time when scaling recipes up or down.</p>

<p>960 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 4 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making soups, stews, or sauces, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency and perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements, especially when working with liquids like chicken broth.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked meals. Using the correct amount of chicken broth—whether 960 ml or another measurement—ensures your dish isn't too dry or overly watery. For example, adding too much broth to a casserole can make it soggy, while too little might leave it dry. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you avoid these pitfalls by providing quick reference guides for common measurements.</p>  

<p>Chicken broth is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from hearty soups to flavourful marinades. If you're working with 960 ml of chicken broth, knowing it's roughly 4 cups simplifies the process. This is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down, ensuring you maintain the right balance of flavours and textures. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on how to use chicken broth in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 960 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup handy, you can still accurately measure 960 ml of chicken broth. A standard metric measuring jug will clearly mark millilitres, making it easy to pour the exact amount needed. Alternatively, you can use a kitchen scale—1 ml of chicken broth weighs roughly 1 gram, so 960 ml would be close to 960 grams. This method is especially handy for those who prefer weighing ingredients for precision.</p>  

<h2>Converting 960 ml of Chicken Broth for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're making a creamy chicken pasta or a light broth-based dish, 960 ml of chicken broth translates to 4 cups. This measurement is consistent across most recipes, but always double-check if the recipe specifies UK or US cup sizes, as they can vary slightly. For example, a UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. In most cases, recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use the standard metric cup (250 ml), making 960 ml equal to just under 4 cups.</p>  

<p>When working with frozen or concentrated chicken broth, remember that dilution may affect the final volume. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions to ensure you're using the correct amount.

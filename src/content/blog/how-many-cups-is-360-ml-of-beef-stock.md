<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when cooking with an air fryer, especially for liquids like beef stock. Too much or too little can affect texture and taste. For example, a sauce might turn out too thin or overly reduced if the stock isn’t measured correctly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Beef stock is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from braised meats to flavourful risottos. Using the right amount ensures your dish stays balanced. If you’re working with 360 ml of beef stock, remember it’s roughly 1.5 cups. This small detail can elevate your cooking from good to great.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 360 ml of Beef Stock Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem. A standard UK mug holds about 300 ml, so 360 ml is just over a mug and a quarter. Alternatively, use a tablespoon—15 ml each—so 24 tablespoons equal 360 ml.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Beef Stock</h3>  
<p>One mistake is confusing millilitres with grams—they’re not the same! Beef stock’s density means 360 ml won’t always weigh 360 grams. Always use liquid measuring tools for accuracy. Another error is eyeballing, which can lead to overly salty or bland dishes.</p>

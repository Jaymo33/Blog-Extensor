<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially with ingredients like double cream. The density of double cream means it doesn't always match the standard liquid conversion. That's why 885 ml of double cream translates to roughly 3.75 cups. This measurement is crucial for recipes where precision matters, such as custards or sauces. If you're unsure, always measure your ingredients carefully to avoid mishaps.

<p>When working with double cream, it's also important to consider the temperature. Cold double cream will measure slightly differently than room-temperature cream. For the most accurate results, let your cream sit for a few minutes before measuring. This ensures your 885 ml of double cream in cups is as precise as possible. Whether you're baking or making a creamy sauce, this small step can make a big difference.</p>

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to deliver perfect results. Too much or too little double cream can affect the texture and taste of your dish. For example, adding 885 ml of double cream instead of 3.75 cups could make a sauce too thick. On the other hand, using less could leave it runny. That's why knowing the exact conversion is key.

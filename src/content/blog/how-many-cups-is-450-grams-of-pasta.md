<p>450 grams of pasta is roughly equivalent to 4.5 to 5 cups, depending on the pasta shape and density.

<h2>Why Accurate Pasta Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of pasta is crucial for air fryer cooking, as overcrowding can lead to uneven results. Too much pasta may not crisp up properly, while too little might dry out.

<p>Different pasta shapes also affect the cup measurement. For example, penne or fusilli take up more space than spaghetti, so 450 grams may yield slightly fewer cups. If you're unsure, weighing your pasta is the most accurate method. Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, provide both weight and volume measurements for convenience.</p>  

<h3>Common Pasta Types and Their Cup Equivalents</h3>  
<p>Long pasta like spaghetti or linguine typically measures about 4.5 cups for 450 grams, while shorter shapes like macaroni or rotini may fill closer to 5 cups. If you're preparing a dish like air fryer pasta salad, fluffing the pasta before measuring ensures accuracy.

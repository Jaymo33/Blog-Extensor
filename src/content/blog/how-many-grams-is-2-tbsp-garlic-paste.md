<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of garlic paste equals approximately 30 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best flavour and texture. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade or seasoning your dish, knowing the exact weight of garlic paste helps avoid over or under-seasoning.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic paste measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of garlic paste can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it could become overpowering. For consistent results, especially in air fryer cooking where flavours intensify, sticking to the 30g measurement for 2 tbsp of garlic paste is key.</p>  
<p>If you’re exploring new recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> for inspiration. Many dishes, from garlic butter shrimp to roasted vegetables, rely on precise garlic paste quantities for that perfect kick.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 2 tbsp of garlic paste accurately</h2>  
<p>Measuring garlic paste can be tricky due to its thick consistency. For the most accurate 30g measurement, use a digital kitchen scale. Simply zero out your scale with an empty bowl, then spoon in the garlic paste until it hits 30g. No scale? Level off your tablespoons with a knife for a close estimate.</p>  
<p>For more tips on converting ingredients, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy resource. It covers common measurements, so you’ll never second-guess quantities again.</p>  

<h3>Does brand affect the weight of garlic paste?</h3>  
<p>Different brands of garlic paste may vary slightly in density, but 2 tbsp generally hovers around 30g. If you’re using a particularly thick or runny paste, a scale ensures precision. For recipes where garlic is the star, like garlic bread or marinades, sticking to 30g guarantees balanced flavour.</p>  

<h3>Can I substitute fresh garlic for garlic paste?</h3>  
<p>Yes, but you’ll need to adjust quantities. One clove of fresh garlic equals about 1 tsp of garlic paste (roughly 5g). So, for 2 tbsp (30g), you’d need around 6 cloves. Fresh garlic offers a sharper taste, while paste provides a mellower, more uniform flavour—ideal for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp garlic paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is a versatile ingredient that elevates countless air fryer dishes. From marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> to seasoning for roasted veggies, 30g (2 tbsp) is a common measurement. Try it in garlic butter for shrimp or as a base for sauces—its concentrated flavour works wonders in the air fryer’s rapid cooking environment.</p>  
<p>For cleaning tips after cooking garlic-heavy dishes, our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> ensures your appliance stays fresh and odour-free.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover garlic paste</h3>  
<p>If you have extra garlic paste, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 1 tbsp (15g), making future recipes a breeze. Just thaw and measure as needed for your next air fryer creation.</p>

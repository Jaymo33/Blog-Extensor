Whether you’re whipping up a marinade or seasoning your dish, knowing the exact weight of garlic paste helps avoid over or under-seasoning.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic paste measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of garlic paste can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it could become overpowering. For consistent results, especially in air fryer cooking where flavours intensify, sticking to the 30g measurement for 2 tbsp of garlic paste is key.</p>

<h2>How to measure 2 tbsp of garlic paste accurately</h2>  
<p>Measuring garlic paste can be tricky due to its thick consistency. For the most accurate 30g measurement, use a digital kitchen scale. Simply zero out your scale with an empty bowl, then spoon in the garlic paste until it hits 30g. No scale? Level off your tablespoons with a knife for a close estimate.</p>

<h3>Does brand affect the weight of garlic paste?</h3>  
<p>Different brands of garlic paste may vary slightly in density, but 2 tbsp generally hovers around 30g. If you’re using a particularly thick or runny paste, a scale ensures precision. For recipes where garlic is the star, like garlic bread or marinades, sticking to 30g guarantees balanced flavour.</p>  

<h3>Can I substitute fresh garlic for garlic paste?</h3>  
<p>Yes, but you’ll need to adjust quantities. One clove of fresh garlic equals about 1 tsp of garlic paste (roughly 5g). So, for 2 tbsp (30g), you’d need around 6 cloves. Fresh garlic offers a sharper taste, while paste provides a mellower, more uniform flavour—ideal for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp garlic paste in air fryer recipes</h2>

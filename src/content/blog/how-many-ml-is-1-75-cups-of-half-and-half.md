<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the correct millilitre measurement for 1.75 cups of half and half ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Too much liquid can make dishes soggy, while too little may dry them out.

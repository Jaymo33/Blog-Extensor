<p>2.5 tablespoons of tahini equals approximately 37.5 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and flavour. Whether you're making homemade hummus or adding tahini to marinades, knowing the exact weight helps avoid recipe mishaps. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate measurements for foolproof cooking. Keep reading for detailed conversion tips and recipe ideas.</p>

<h2>Why accurate tahini measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of tahini can make or break your air fryer dishes. Too little and your sauces lack creaminess, too much and flavours become overpowering. The density of tahini means volume measurements (like tablespoons) can vary slightly between brands. That's why weight measurements in grams are more reliable for consistent results. Many of our favourite <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for precise tahini quantities. Whether you're making dressings or baking tahini cookies, 37.5 grams gives you the perfect starting point.</p>

<p>For those who love Middle Eastern-inspired air fryer meals, tahini is a staple ingredient. It adds richness to marinades for chicken or vegetables, and helps create crispy coatings. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> takes the guesswork out of adapting traditional recipes for your air fryer. Remember that tahini's thickness can vary - stirred versions are slightly less dense than unstirred. When measuring, always level off your tablespoons for accuracy.</p>

<h3>Converting other tahini quantities</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for different amounts of tahini, here's a handy guide: 1 tablespoon equals 15 grams, while 3 tablespoons would be 45 grams. For larger quantities, 100 grams of tahini equals about 6.5 tablespoons. These conversions are particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> use tahini as a flavourful drizzle or dip. Having these measurements at your fingertips means you can adapt any recipe with confidence.</p>

<h2>Using tahini in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Tahini isn't just for dips - it's incredibly versatile in air fryer cooking. Mixed with spices, it creates a delicious crust on chicken or tofu. Combined with lemon juice and garlic, it makes a fantastic sauce for roasted vegetables. The 37.5 grams from your 2.5 tablespoons can transform simple ingredients into exciting meals. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love experimenting with tahini in unexpected ways. Try brushing it on cauliflower steaks before air frying for a nutty, caramelised finish.</p>

<p>When working with tahini in your air fryer, remember it can burn at high temperatures. For best results, combine it with oil or other liquids when using it as a coating. Our collection of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> includes several tahini-marinated options that cook perfectly in the air fryer. The 2.5 tablespoon (37.5g) measurement works beautifully for marinades serving 2-4 people. Always give your tahini a good stir before measuring, as the oil naturally separates during storage.</p>

<h3>Storing and measuring tahini properly</h3>
<p>To ensure accurate measurements every time, store your tahini jar upside down after opening. This helps redistribute the oils and makes stirring easier when you're ready to use it. For the most precise 2.5 tablespoon (37.5g) measurement, use proper measuring spoons rather than eating utensils. If you're converting a recipe that lists tahini in cups, remember that 1 cup equals about 240 grams. After cooking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> can help remove any sticky tahini residue from your air fryer basket.</p>

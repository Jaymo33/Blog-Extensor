<p>3 tablespoons of cornflour equals approximately 24 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, whether you're coating chicken, thickening sauces, or baking. Getting the measurement right ensures your dishes have the perfect texture and consistency every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate cornflour measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of cornflour in your air fryer recipes makes all the difference. Too little and your coatings won't crisp up properly; too much and you'll end up with a chalky texture. Many air fryer enthusiasts swear by weighing ingredients rather than using volume measurements for consistent results. You can find more handy conversion tips on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<p>Cornflour behaves differently from plain flour in recipes, absorbing more liquid and creating a lighter crisp. This makes it particularly popular for air fryer coatings on foods like chicken wings or tempura vegetables. When following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll notice many specify weights rather than volumes for this reason.</p>

<h2>How to measure 3 tbsp of cornflour accurately</h2>
<p>The most reliable way to measure 3 tablespoons of cornflour is by using proper measuring spoons. Scoop the cornflour into the spoon and level it off with a straight edge for an accurate measurement. For those who prefer precision, digital kitchen scales remove all guesswork - simply tare your bowl and measure out 24 grams.</p>

<h3>Converting other cornflour measurements</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for different amounts, here are some common conversions: 1 tablespoon equals 8 grams, 2 tablespoons equal 16 grams, and 4 tablespoons equal 32 grams. These conversions are particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> includes many dishes where these measurements come in handy.</p>

<h2>Using cornflour in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Cornflour is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, perfect for creating crispy coatings without deep frying. It's commonly used in recipes like Korean fried chicken, onion bhajis, or even as a thickener for sauces accompanying air fried dishes. The light texture it creates helps achieve that desirable crunch while keeping things healthier than traditional frying methods.</p>

<p>When preparing batters or coatings with cornflour for your air fryer, remember that 3 tablespoons (24 grams) is often enough for coating about 500g of protein or vegetables. For more inspiration on using cornflour in your air fryer, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> which features several cornflour-based coatings.</p>

<h3>Storing cornflour for best results</h3>
<p>To ensure your cornflour measurements remain accurate over time, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Humidity can cause cornflour to clump, potentially affecting your measurements when you scoop it. Proper storage maintains its free-flowing properties, making it easier to measure out those perfect 3 tablespoons (24 grams) every time.</p>

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring cornflour</h2>
<p>One frequent error is packing cornflour into the measuring spoon, which can nearly double the actual amount. Always spoon cornflour lightly into the measuring spoon and level it off. Another mistake is confusing cornflour with cornmeal or polenta - these have completely different weights and properties. For 3 tablespoons of cornflour to grams conversions, you're specifically looking at the fine, white powder used for thickening and coating.</p>

<p>After using cornflour in your air fryer, you might notice some residue. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> can help remove any stubborn cornflour buildup. Remember, keeping your appliance clean ensures better cooking performance for all your recipes.</p>

<p>100g of self-raising flour equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or savoury dishes, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you master these conversions for flawless cooking every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 100g of Self-Raising Flour to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, while some older cookbooks or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 100g of self-raising flour to ounces (3.53 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount for your dish. This is particularly important for baking, where precision affects texture and rise. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for you.</p>
<p>Self-raising flour is a staple in British baking, and its weight can vary slightly depending on how it’s measured. Scooping directly from the bag compacts the flour, while spooning it lightly keeps it airy. For accuracy, we recommend using digital scales. If you’re working with cups, check our guide for converting grams to cups as well.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 100g of Self-Raising Flour Accurately</h2>
<p>To measure 100g of self-raising flour correctly, use a digital kitchen scale for the most precise results. Place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add the flour until it reads 100g. If you don’t have scales, 100g is roughly 3.53 ounces or about ¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons, but this can vary slightly. For air fryer recipes, precision is key to avoid dense or unevenly cooked bakes.</p>

<h3>Using Ounces in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>When adapting recipes for your air fryer, converting 100g of self-raising flour to ounces (3.53 oz) ensures the right balance of ingredients. Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so accurate measurements prevent over-drying or undercooking. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration, from fluffy cakes to crispy treats.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes When Converting Flour Measurements</h2>
<p>One common mistake is confusing fluid ounces (volume) with avoirdupois ounces (weight). Since flour is measured by weight, 100g equals 3.53 avoirdupois ounces, not fluid ounces. Another error is packing flour into a measuring cup, which can add up to 20% more flour than needed. Always fluff the flour first, then spoon it lightly into the cup for the closest approximation.</p>
<p>For best results, stick to weight measurements where possible. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> takes the guesswork out of adjusting ingredient quantities. This is especially handy for air fryer baking, where small batches are common.</p>

<h3>Self-Raising Flour vs. Plain Flour in Conversions</h3>
<p>Self-raising flour and plain flour weigh the same, so 100g of either equals 3.53 ounces. However, self-raising flour contains baking powder and salt, which affect the recipe’s chemistry. If substituting, remember to add 1 teaspoon of baking powder per 100g of plain flour. For more tips, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>

<h2>Tools to Simplify 100g to Ounces Conversions</h2>
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the most reliable tool for converting 100g of self-raising flour to ounces. Look for one with both metric (grams) and imperial (ounces) settings. If you’re without scales, online converters or mobile apps can help, but always double-check their accuracy. For air fryer enthusiasts, keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, saves time and ensures perfect results.</p>

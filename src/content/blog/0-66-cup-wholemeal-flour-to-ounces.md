<p>0.66 cup of wholemeal flour equals approximately 2.64 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you’re whipping up air fryer cakes or bread, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Measuring flour by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) is crucial for baking success. Wholemeal flour can settle or fluff up, leading to inconsistent cup measurements. In an air fryer, where heat distribution is rapid, precise ratios ensure even cooking. A slight variation in flour weight can affect texture, rise, and browning. For perfect air fryer cakes or cookies, always weigh your ingredients.</p>  

<p>Wholemeal flour is denser than white flour, so 0.66 cup (2.64 oz) packs more nutritional punch. If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, note that weights may differ slightly based on brand or grind. For best results, use a kitchen scale—especially for air fryer recipes, where precision is key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.66 cup of wholemeal flour</h3>  
<p>Spoon wholemeal flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife for the most accurate 0.66 cup measurement. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour. For 2.64 oz, a digital scale is foolproof. If you’re scaling up, remember: 1 cup of wholemeal flour ≈ 4 oz, so 0.66 cup is roughly two-thirds of that.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.66 cup wholemeal flour</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for small-batch air fryer baking. Try it in wholemeal muffins, flatbreads, or coating for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>. The nutty flavour of wholemeal flour adds depth to recipes, and 2.64 oz is often just enough for a single serving. It’s also ideal for thickening sauces or dusting surfaces when rolling dough.</p>  

<p>For meal preppers, 0.66 cup (2.64 oz) portions can streamline baking. Pre-measure flour into containers for quick weekday recipes. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep ideas</a> to make the most of your air fryer. Wholemeal flour’s fibre content keeps you fuller longer, making it a smart choice for healthy eating.</p>  

<h3>Converting other flour amounts to ounces</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different quantity, here’s a quick reference: 1/4 cup ≈ 1 oz, 1/2 cup ≈ 2 oz, and 1 cup ≈ 4 oz. For irregular amounts like 0.66 cup, a scale eliminates guesswork. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> handy—wholemeal flour can leave more residue than white flour.</p>  

<h2>Tips for baking with wholemeal flour in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Wholemeal flour absorbs more liquid than white flour, so adjust wet ingredients slightly. For 0.66 cup (2.64 oz), add an extra tablespoon of liquid if the batter seems dry. Air fryers circulate hot air, which can dry out baked goods faster. Covering loosely with foil halfway through prevents over-browning.</p>  

<p>Store wholemeal flour in an airtight container to maintain freshness. Since 0.66 cup is a smaller amount, it’s easy to use up quickly.

Wholemeal flour adds a hearty texture to air fryer brownies and scones—just measure carefully!</p>

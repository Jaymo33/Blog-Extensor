<p>685 ml of yogurt is approximately 2.89 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using recipes that require precise measurements, especially when baking or cooking with an air fryer. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups can make all the difference in your dish's success.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in baking and cooking, particularly when using an air fryer. Too much or too little yogurt can affect the texture and taste of your dish. For example, if you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake</a>, the right amount of yogurt ensures moisture without making it soggy. Similarly, in savoury dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken marinades</a>, yogurt helps tenderise the meat.</p>
<p>Using 685 ml of yogurt in cups ensures consistency across recipes. This is especially helpful if you're scaling a recipe up or down. A <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can be a lifesaver for quick reference, but knowing the exact conversion for 685 ml of yogurt to cups eliminates guesswork.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 685 ml of Yogurt</h2>
<p>Measuring 685 ml of yogurt accurately is simple with the right tools. A liquid measuring cup is ideal for this task, as it provides clear markings for millilitres and cups. If you don't have one, a standard metric measuring jug will work just as well. Simply pour the yogurt into the jug until it reaches the 685 ml mark.</p>
<p>For those who prefer using cups, 685 ml of yogurt equals roughly 2.89 cups. This measurement is based on the standard US cup, which holds 240 ml. If you're using a UK cup, which is 284 ml, the conversion will differ slightly. Always check which cup measurement your recipe uses to avoid errors.</p>

<h3>Converting 685 ml of Yogurt for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>When preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. For instance, if a recipe calls for 685 ml of yogurt, you'll need to know how many cups that is. This is particularly important for dishes like yogurt-marinated chicken or baked goods, where the yogurt's consistency affects the outcome.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 685 ml of Yogurt</h2>
<p>685 ml of yogurt is a versatile ingredient in many recipes. It's commonly used in marinades, dips, and baked goods. For example, you might use it in a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> like yogurt cake or a savoury dish like tzatziki. Knowing how many cups 685 ml of yogurt equals helps you adapt recipes to your needs.</p>
<p>Yogurt is also a great substitute for heavier ingredients like cream or buttermilk. If you're health-conscious, using yogurt in place of these can reduce calories without sacrificing flavour. Whether you're making a smoothie or a curry, 685 ml of yogurt provides the perfect balance of creaminess and tang.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Yogurt</h3>
<p>If you have leftover yogurt after measuring out 685 ml, proper storage is key to maintaining freshness. Keep it in an airtight container in the fridge, and use it within a few days. Yogurt can also be frozen for longer storage, though its texture may change slightly upon thawing.</p>

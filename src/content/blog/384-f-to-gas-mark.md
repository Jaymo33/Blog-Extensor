<p>384 F converts to Gas Mark 5 in UK ovens and air fryers. This medium-high temperature is perfect for roasting vegetables, baking cakes, or cooking meats in your air fryer. Whether you're following a traditional oven recipe or adapting it for your air fryer, knowing this conversion is essential for perfect results.</p>

<h2>Understanding 384 F to Gas Mark Conversion</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark system is uniquely British, with each number representing a specific temperature range. Gas Mark 5 corresponds to 375-400 F, making 384 F fall neatly within this bracket. When using your air fryer, this temperature works well for most baked goods and roasted dishes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend checking our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common temperature conversions.</p>
<p>Many air fryer models display temperatures in Fahrenheit, Celsius, and sometimes Gas Mark. If yours doesn't show Gas Mark, remember that 384 F equals Gas Mark 5. This temperature is particularly useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> that require even, moderate heat. The circulating air in an air fryer often means you can reduce cooking times by 20% compared to conventional ovens.</p>

<h2>When to Use 384 F (Gas Mark 5) in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Gas Mark 5 (384 F) is ideal for a variety of air fryer dishes. It's hot enough to crisp foods without burning them, while still allowing thorough cooking. This temperature works perfectly for roasting potatoes, baking cookies, or cooking chicken pieces. The hot air circulation in air fryers means food often cooks faster than in conventional ovens at the same temperature.</p>
<p>For frozen foods like chips or chicken nuggets, 384 F (Gas Mark 5) gives excellent results. The high heat crisps the exterior while ensuring the interior cooks through. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen food recipes</a> for more inspiration. Remember to shake the basket halfway through cooking for even results when using this temperature setting.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times at 384 F</h3>
<p>When converting oven recipes to air fryer at 384 F (Gas Mark 5), reduce cooking times by about 20%. A cake that takes 30 minutes in a conventional oven might only need 24 minutes in the air fryer. Always check food 5 minutes before the suggested time, as air fryers can vary in performance.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Baking at 384 F</h3>
<p>Baking at 384 F (Gas Mark 5) in an air fryer requires some adjustments. Use smaller baking tins that fit your air fryer basket, and consider covering delicate items with foil halfway through cooking. For perfect <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, bake at 384 F for slightly less time than the recipe suggests, checking frequently.</p>

<h2>Comparing 384 F to Other Common Temperatures</h2>
<p>384 F (Gas Mark 5) sits between medium and high heat settings. It's slightly cooler than Gas Mark 6 (400 F) but hotter than Gas Mark 4 (350 F). This makes it versatile for both baking and roasting. Many air fryer manufacturers recommend this temperature range for achieving crispy textures without excessive browning.</p>
<p>When cooking multiple items at once in your air fryer at 384 F, you might need to extend the cooking time slightly. The compact space means air circulation remains efficient, but more food requires more energy to cook through. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes specific timing guidance for various dishes at this temperature.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Your Air Fryer at High Temperatures</h2>
<p>Regularly cooking at 384 F (Gas Mark 5) means your air fryer needs proper maintenance. Food particles can burn onto surfaces at these temperatures, so clean your air fryer after each use. We recommend using our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> to keep your appliance in top condition.</p>
<p>At 384 F, some air fryer models may produce more smoke, especially when cooking fatty foods. To prevent this, trim excess fat from meats and avoid overcrowding the basket. Proper ventilation around your air fryer is also important when operating at these higher temperature settings.</p>

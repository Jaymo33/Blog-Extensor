<p>635 ml of corn syrup equals approximately 2.68 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making sticky buns or glazes, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking. Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of corn syrup can make or break a recipe. Too much can lead to overly sticky or sweet results, while too little may leave dishes dry. Air fryers cook quickly, so precision is key to avoid burning or undercooking. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a> rely on exact measurements for perfect texture. Always measure liquids like corn syrup in a clear measuring jug for accuracy.</p>  

<p>Corn syrup is thicker than water, so it’s best to use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry cups. If you’re unsure, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps. Many bakers prefer weighing ingredients, but cups remain popular in home kitchens.

<h3>How to Measure 635 ml of Corn Syrup Correctly</h3>  
<p>Pour corn syrup into a liquid measuring cup up to the 635 ml mark, then level it off. If you don’t have metric measurements, use the 2.68 cups conversion. For sticky ingredients like corn syrup, lightly grease the measuring cup first to help it slide out easily. This trick works wonders for air fryer glazes and sauces.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 635 ml of Corn Syrup</h2>  
<p>Many classic desserts call for roughly 635 ml (2.68 cups) of corn syrup. Pecan pies, marshmallow treats, and caramel sauces often use this amount.

<h3>UK vs US Cup Measurements for Corn Syrup</h3>  
<p>While 635 ml converts to 2.68 US cups, UK cups are slightly different at 2.52 cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses. Most modern UK recipes now adopt metric measurements or US cups for consistency. When in doubt, stick to millilitres for precision, especially in air fryer cooking where small differences can affect results.</p>

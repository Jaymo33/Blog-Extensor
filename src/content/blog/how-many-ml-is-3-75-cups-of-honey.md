Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adapting a family favourite, getting the quantities right ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Honey is a key ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from glazes to baked goods. Its viscosity means even small measurement errors can alter the outcome. For example, 3.75 cups of honey in ml (887.21ml) is crucial for balancing sweetness and moisture in cakes or marinades. Using the correct millilitre measurement ensures your dish isn’t too dry or overly sticky.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those found in the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a>, rely on honey for its natural sweetness. A slight variation in the 3.75 cups of honey to ml conversion could affect browning or caramelisation. This is why professional bakers and home cooks alike prefer weighing or measuring liquids like honey in millilitres for consistency.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 3.75 Cups of Honey in ml</h2>  
<p>To convert 3.75 cups of honey to ml, you’ll need to know that 1 US cup equals approximately 236.59ml. Multiplying this by 3.75 gives you 887.21ml.

<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, use a kitchen scale. Honey weighs roughly 340 grams per cup, so 3.75 cups would be around 1275 grams. This method is handy when adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> that list ingredients by weight rather than volume.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements for Honey</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cups affects how many ml 3.75 cups of honey will be. In the US, a standard cup is 240ml (rounded), while the UK uses 250ml. For honey, which is thick and sticky, these small differences can add up. Always clarify which cup measurement your recipe uses, especially if it’s from an international source.</p>

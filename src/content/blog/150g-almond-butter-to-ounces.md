<p>Using a kitchen scale is the best way to measure almond butter, as volume measurements (like cups) can vary. For sticky ingredients like almond butter, lightly oiling your measuring spoon or cup helps with accuracy. If you’re converting other nut butters, like peanut or cashew, the weight-to-ounce ratio remains the same.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 150g of almond butter without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can estimate 150g of almond butter using tablespoons. One tablespoon of almond butter weighs roughly 16g, so 150g is about 9.5 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise, so investing in a scale is ideal for consistent results.

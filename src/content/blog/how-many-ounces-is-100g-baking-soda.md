<p>100g of baking soda is approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up fluffy cakes or crispy snacks, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of baking soda is crucial for achieving the perfect rise in baked goods. Too little, and your cakes may turn out dense; too much, and they could taste bitter. The air fryer’s rapid circulation means ingredients must be measured precisely to avoid uneven cooking. For more tips on perfecting your recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, making conversions a common challenge. If you’re working with a mix of measurements, our guide ensures you never second-guess your quantities. Whether you’re baking or cleaning your air fryer with baking soda, accuracy is key.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 100g of baking soda without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 100g of baking soda using volume. One tablespoon of baking soda weighs roughly 10g, so 10 tablespoons equal 100g. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so for best results, invest in a digital scale. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for more measurement hacks.</p>  

<h3>Common uses of baking soda in air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>Baking soda isn’t just for cakes—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It helps crisp up chicken wings, tenderise meats, and even clean your air fryer basket. For a deep clean, mix baking soda with water and scrub gently. Visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for more tips.</p>  

<h2>Converting other common baking ingredients</h2>  
<p>Just like 100g of baking soda equals 3.53 ounces, other ingredients follow similar conversions. For example, 100g of flour is about 3.53 ounces, while 100g of sugar is roughly 3.53 ounces as well. Consistency in measurements ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

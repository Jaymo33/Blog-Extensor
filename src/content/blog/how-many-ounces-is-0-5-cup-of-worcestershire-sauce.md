<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little worcestershire sauce can throw off the balance of your dish. For example, a marinade with 0.5 cup of worcestershire sauce (4.23 ounces) will have a richer taste than one with less. This is especially important for recipes like air-fried beef or chicken, where the sauce plays a key role. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration.</p>

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts swear by measuring liquids by weight rather than volume for better accuracy. This is because worcestershire sauce, like other liquids, can vary slightly in density. Using ounces ensures you’re getting the exact amount needed, whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.

<h3>How to measure worcestershire sauce for air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>To measure 0.5 cup of worcestershire sauce (4.23 ounces), use a liquid measuring cup for volume or a kitchen scale for weight. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup equals 8.45 ounces, so halving it gives you the correct amount. This method works for all air fryer recipes, from marinades to glazes. For cleaning tips after cooking, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 cup of worcestershire sauce</h2>
<p>Half a cup of worcestershire sauce is often used in marinades for meats like beef, chicken, or even tofu. It adds a umami-rich flavour that enhances the taste of air-fried dishes. For example, a 0.5 cup (4.23 ounces) of worcestershire sauce mixed with garlic and oil makes a fantastic marinade for air-fried steak. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef recipes</a> for ideas.</p>

<p>Another popular use is in sauces or glazes for air-fried vegetables or seafood. A blend of 0.5 cup worcestershire sauce, honey, and mustard can transform simple shrimp or mushrooms into a gourmet dish.

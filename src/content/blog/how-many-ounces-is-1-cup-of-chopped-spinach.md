<p>1 cup of chopped spinach weighs approximately 1.5 ounces (42 grams). This measurement is key for air fryer recipes where precise quantities ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're making crispy spinach chips or adding greens to a dish, knowing the weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate spinach measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of chopped spinach ensures your air fryer dishes turn out just right. Too much spinach can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might leave your meal lacking in flavour. Spinach shrinks significantly when cooked, so measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups). This is especially important for recipes like air-fried spinach and feta parcels or crispy spinach snacks. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Chopped spinach is a versatile ingredient, but its light, leafy texture means it can be tricky to measure. Packing it tightly into a cup can nearly double the weight, while loosely filled cups may weigh less. For consistent results, use a kitchen scale to measure 1.5 ounces (42 grams) per cup. This method removes guesswork and guarantees perfect portions every time.</p>  

<h3>Converting cups to ounces for spinach</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, visual cues can help. One cup of loosely packed chopped spinach is roughly a large handful, while tightly packed spinach fills the cup more densely. For UK cooks, remember that 1 cup equals 8 fluid ounces, but the weight in ounces differs. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipe category</a> includes more tips for prepping greens in the air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for chopped spinach in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Chopped spinach works beautifully in air fryer recipes, from stuffed chicken breasts to veggie-packed frittatas. Because spinach cooks quickly, it’s ideal for air frying, which retains nutrients better than boiling. A cup of chopped spinach (1.5 ounces) adds vibrant colour and iron-rich goodness to dishes like air-fryer spanakopita or spinach-stuffed mushrooms. For cleaning tips after cooking greens, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>  

<p>Frozen chopped spinach is another great option, but it usually comes pre-measured in ounces. Thaw and drain it well before using to avoid excess moisture in your air fryer. One 10-ounce pack of frozen spinach equals about 1.5 cups when thawed, making conversions simple. Whether fresh or frozen, spinach is a star ingredient for healthy air-fried meals.</p>  

<h3>Tips for measuring spinach without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you’re without a scale, fluff the spinach lightly with a fork before measuring to avoid compaction. Gently press it into the cup without squeezing—think of how you’d fill a cup with flour for baking. For recipes where precision matters, like spinach dips or layered bakes, weighing is best.

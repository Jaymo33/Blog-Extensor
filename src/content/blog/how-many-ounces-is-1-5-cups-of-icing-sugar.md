<p>1.5 cups of icing sugar equals approximately 6 ounces (or 170 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using air fryers for desserts where precision matters. Whether you’re making frosting, dusting cakes, or preparing air fryer-friendly treats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in baking</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in measurements can affect texture and taste. Icing sugar, also known as powdered sugar, is often used in delicate recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or cookies. Using 1.5 cups of icing sugar without converting to ounces could lead to overly sweet or dense results. For air fryer recipes, where heat distribution is rapid, precise measurements prevent burning or uneven cooking.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients rather than relying on cup measurements. Scales provide accuracy, especially when dealing with fluffy ingredients like icing sugar. If you’re adapting a US recipe, converting 1.5 cups of icing sugar to ounces (6 oz) ensures you stay true to the intended outcome. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 cups of icing sugar correctly</h3>  
<p>To get the most accurate 6-ounce measurement, spoon the icing sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the sugar, leading to more than 1.5 cups by weight. For air fryer recipes, sifting the sugar afterward ensures a smooth texture in batters or frostings.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 cups of icing sugar</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for making buttercream frosting, glazes, or dusting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> like doughnuts or churros. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, recipes often require slight adjustments. Knowing that 1.5 cups of icing sugar equals 6 ounces helps maintain balance in sweetness and structure.</p>  

<p>If you’re preparing a large batch of cookies or cupcakes, you might need to scale up. For example, 3 cups would be 12 ounces, and so on. Always store leftover icing sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping, especially in humid kitchens. For more baking inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sugar measurements</h3>  
<p>Granulated sugar weighs differently than icing sugar—1.5 cups of granulated sugar is about 10.5 ounces. Confusion between the two can ruin a recipe. Always double-check whether your recipe calls for icing or granulated sugar, particularly in air fryer baking where moisture levels are critical.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with icing sugar in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers excel at creating crispy textures, but sugary coatings can caramelise quickly. If your recipe involves dusting or glazing, apply icing sugar after cooking. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a>, mix the 1.5 cups (6 ounces) of icing sugar into the dough evenly to avoid hotspots.</p>  

<p>Cleaning up after working with icing sugar is easier if you wipe your air fryer basket with a damp cloth before residues harden. For stubborn sugar buildup, our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> offers practical solutions. Remember, precise measurements like 1.5 cups to ounces (6 oz) make cleanup predictable too!</p>

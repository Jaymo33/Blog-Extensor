<p>0.375 cup of tomato paste equals approximately 3 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're preparing a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home. Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it effectively.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Tomato paste, being dense, requires precise measurement to avoid overpowering or underwhelming flavours. A 0.375 cup measurement translates to 3 ounces, which is perfect for recipes serving 2–4 people. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. This ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time, whether you're cooking for family or friends.</p>  

<p>Using the right amount of tomato paste also affects texture and moisture levels. Too much can make your dish overly thick, while too little might leave it bland. If you're experimenting with new recipes, always start with accurate measurements like 0.375 cup (3 ounces) and adjust as needed. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection, where precision meets creativity.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.375 cup of tomato paste</h3>  
<p>Measuring 0.375 cup of tomato paste is simple with the right tools. Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, or weigh it on a kitchen scale for exact ounces. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of tomato paste equals 8 ounces, so 0.375 cup is 3 ounces. This method works for both UK and US measurements, ensuring consistency across recipes.

<h2>Common uses for 0.375 cup of tomato paste</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste is a versatile ingredient, especially in air fryer cooking. A 0.375 cup (3-ounce) portion is ideal for marinades, sauces, and stews. It adds depth to dishes like air-fried meatballs or roasted vegetables. If you're preparing a larger batch, scale up the measurement accordingly. For recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where tomato paste often plays a starring role.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 0.375 cup of tomato paste is in homemade pizza sauces. Spread it thinly on your dough before adding toppings for a rich, tangy base. The air fryer crisps the crust beautifully, making it a favourite for quick meals. Remember, keeping your air fryer clean is just as important as accurate measurements.

<h3>Tips for storing leftover tomato paste</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover tomato paste after measuring 0.375 cup, store it properly to avoid waste. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to a week, or freeze it in ice cube trays for longer storage. This way, you’ll always have the right amount on hand for your next air fryer adventure.

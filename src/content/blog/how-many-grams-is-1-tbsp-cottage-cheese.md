<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of cottage cheese weighs approximately 15 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're adding cottage cheese to a breakfast bake or a savoury dish, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-measuring.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off your results. Too much cottage cheese might make a dish soggy, while too little could leave it dry. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer breakfast muffins</a>, 15 grams per tablespoon ensures the right balance of moisture and flavour.</p>  
<p>If you're converting from volume to weight, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend. Unlike scooping, which can vary, weighing ingredients like cottage cheese guarantees consistency.

<h2>How to Measure 1 Tbsp of Cottage Cheese Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate 15-gram measurement, lightly spoon cottage cheese into a tablespoon without packing it down. If you press it in, you might end up with 20 grams or more, altering your recipe. This tip is especially useful for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfast casseroles</a>.</p>  

<h3>Does Cottage Cheese Type Affect the Weight?</h3>  
<p>Full-fat, low-fat, and whipped cottage cheese have slight density differences, but 1 tbsp still averages 15 grams. For whipped varieties, fluff it lightly before measuring to avoid compaction. Always double-check if a recipe specifies a particular type, as fat content can impact cooking results.</p>

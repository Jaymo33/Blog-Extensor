<p>422°F converts to approximately 220°C in a fan oven. This is the standard equivalent used in UK kitchens and air fryers, making it easy to switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius settings. Whether you're baking, roasting, or air frying, knowing this conversion ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 422 F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Many recipes, especially those from the US, use Fahrenheit rather than Celsius. If you're using a fan oven or air fryer in the UK, you'll need to convert 422°F to the correct fan oven temperature. Fan ovens circulate hot air, which cooks food more evenly and often faster than conventional ovens. This means you might need to adjust the temperature slightly to avoid overcooking.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend checking your appliance's manual for specific guidance. Some air fryers have preset functions that automatically adjust the temperature for you. If you're adapting a recipe, it's always best to start with a lower temperature and increase if needed.</p>

<h2>How to Use 422 F in an Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Air fryers work similarly to fan ovens, using rapid air technology to cook food. When converting 422°F for an air fryer, you'll typically use the same 220°C setting. However, cooking times may vary due to the air fryer's compact size and powerful fan. For example, chicken wings might cook faster in an air fryer than in a traditional oven.</p>
<p>We've found that most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> work well at this temperature for items like roasted vegetables, baked goods, and even some frozen foods. Just remember to shake or turn your food halfway through cooking to ensure even browning. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help you adjust other temperatures too.</p>

<h3>Common Foods Cooked at 422 F (220°C Fan)</h3>
<p>This temperature works perfectly for many dishes. Roast potatoes become crispy on the outside while staying fluffy inside at 220°C fan. Pizza reheats beautifully, and cookies bake evenly. Even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> benefit from this temperature, giving you golden skin without drying out the meat.</p>

<h2>Temperature Conversion Tips</h2>
<p>When converting between Fahrenheit and Celsius for fan ovens, remember that 25°F equals about 15°C in most cases. This simple ratio helps with quick mental calculations. For 422°F specifically, you can subtract 32 (390), multiply by 5 (1950), then divide by 9 (216.66), and finally round to 220°C for fan ovens.</p>
<p>Some ovens have different convection settings, so it's worth experimenting. We recommend keeping an oven thermometer to verify your appliance's accuracy. You might find our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> helpful for maintaining consistent temperatures.</p>

<h3>Fan Oven vs Conventional Oven</h3>
<p>Traditional ovens without fans typically require about 20°C higher than fan ovens for the same result. So where a fan oven uses 220°C, a conventional oven would need about 240°C. This difference matters when converting recipes not specifically designed for fan ovens or air fryers.</p>

<p>3 cups of sunflower seeds weigh approximately 12 ounces (340 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for perfectly roasted seeds every time. Whether you're snacking or adding them to a dish, knowing the weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of sunflower seeds ensures even cooking and optimal flavour. Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so overcrowding or underfilling can affect results. For example, too many seeds may not crisp up properly, while too few could burn. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Sunflower seeds are a versatile ingredient, great for salads, granola, or as a standalone snack. Measuring by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) guarantees consistency, especially when scaling recipes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for creative ways to use them.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Sunflower Seeds Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your sunflower seeds. If you don’t have one, fluff the seeds in the bag before scooping them into a measuring cup. Level off the top with a straight edge for an exact 3-cup measure.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Sunflower Seeds</h3>  
<p>Packing the seeds too tightly into the cup can lead to an incorrect weight. Similarly, using a heaped cup adds extra ounces, throwing off your recipe. Always measure lightly for the best air fryer results.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Ounces for Other Ingredients</h2>  
<p>Different ingredients have varying densities, so 3 cups of one item won’t always equal 12 ounces. For example, 3 cups of flour weigh around 12.75 ounces, while 3 cups of chopped nuts may differ. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/snacks>snack category</a> for more air fryer-friendly ideas.</p>  

<p>If you’re unsure, refer to a trusted conversion chart or weigh your ingredients beforehand. This small step can make a big difference in your air fryer cooking. Need cleaning tips?

<h2>Best Air Fryer Recipes Using Sunflower Seeds</h2>  
<p>Sunflower seeds add crunch and nutrition to many dishes. Try them in air-fried granola bars, sprinkled over roasted vegetables, or mixed into homemade breading. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> featuring seeds.</p>  

<p>Remember, 3 cups of sunflower seeds equal roughly 12 ounces, making it easy to adjust portion sizes. Whether you’re meal prepping or experimenting, precise measurements ensure delicious results every time.</p>

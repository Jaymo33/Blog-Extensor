<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of cream—or any ingredient—ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time. Too much cream can make dishes overly rich, while too little might leave them dry. Converting 0.5 cups of cream to grams (120g) helps avoid guesswork, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>. Precision is key, whether you’re baking a cake or making a creamy pasta sauce.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on balanced ingredients. Cream, in particular, can affect texture and moisture levels. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> like cheesecake requires exact measurements to set properly. By knowing that 0.5 cups of cream equals 120 grams, you can confidently adapt recipes without compromising results.</p>  

<h3>Types of Cream and Their Weights</h3>  
<p>Not all creams weigh the same—double cream, whipping cream, and single cream have slight variations in density. However, 0.5 cups of most standard creams (like whipping cream) will still hover around 120 grams. If you’re using a thicker or lighter variant, consider weighing it for absolute accuracy. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guide</a> to keep your air fryer in top shape.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes use metric measurements, making it crucial to know conversions like 0.5 cups of cream to grams. This avoids the hassle of switching between measuring tools mid-recipe. A kitchen scale is a worthwhile investment for anyone serious about air fryer cooking. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, where precise cream measurements are often key.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with a recipe that lists 0.5 cups of cream in grams (120g), you can trust this conversion for consistent results. Whether you’re making a creamy soup or a decadent frosting, accuracy ensures the perfect balance of flavours and textures.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Cream</h3>  
<p>One mistake is scooping cream directly with a measuring cup, which can lead to uneven amounts. Instead, spoon the cream into the cup and level it off for accuracy. Another error is assuming all creams weigh the same—always check the type you’re using. For example, 0.5 cups of clotted cream will weigh more than 120 grams due to its density.</p>

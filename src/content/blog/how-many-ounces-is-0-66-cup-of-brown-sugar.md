<p>0.66 cup of brown sugar equals approximately 5.28 ounces (or 5 ¼ oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures perfect texture and sweetness. Whether you’re whipping up cookies, cakes, or glazes, knowing how many ounces are in 0.66 cup of brown sugar saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate brown sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Brown sugar’s moisture content means it packs differently than granulated sugar, so volume-to-weight conversions like 0.66 cup to ounces are crucial. Too much sugar can make air fryer desserts overly sticky, while too little affects caramelisation. For consistent results, use a kitchen scale—especially with recipes from <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> that rely on precise ratios.</p>  

<p>Popular air fryer treats like sticky toffee pudding or cinnamon rolls often call for 0.66 cup of brown sugar. Converting this to ounces (5.28 oz) ensures even distribution and avoids clumping. Check out our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common baking measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.66 cup of brown sugar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, spoon brown sugar into a measuring cup and level it off—don’t pack it down. For 0.66 cup, fill a standard cup two-thirds full. This method gets you close to 5.28 ounces, though scales are more reliable. Recipes like air fryer chocolate chip cookies from <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies">our cookie category</a> benefit from exact measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.66 cup of brown sugar in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for small-batch air fryer desserts. Think crumbles, glazes for salmon (<a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon">try these recipes</a>), or BBQ rubs. At 5.28 ounces, it’s enough to sweeten a family-sized apple crisp or a marinade for tofu. The air fryer’s rapid heat helps brown sugar caramelise evenly, enhancing flavour.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, 0.66 cup (5.28 oz) of brown sugar balances spices in pulled pork or baked beans.

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>

<p>Different countries use varying cup sizes, so it's important to note whether your recipe follows UK or US measurements. In the UK, a cup is typically 250 ml, while in the US, it's 236.59 ml. This slight difference can affect your recipe, so always double-check the origin of your measurements. If you're unsure, stick to the standard 236.59 ml per cup for consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Precision is key in cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer. Too much or too little milk can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, adding too much milk to a cake batter can make it soggy, while too little can result in a dry, crumbly texture. Accurate measurements ensure your recipes turn out as intended, whether you're making a creamy pasta sauce or a fluffy sponge cake.</p>

<p>If you're working with a recipe that lists ingredients in millilitres but prefer using cups, this conversion will save you time and hassle. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> provide measurements in both units, but knowing how to convert them yourself gives you more flexibility in the kitchen. It also helps when scaling recipes up or down to suit your needs.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 660 ml of Milk</h3>
<p>660 ml of milk is a common measurement in many recipes, from desserts to savoury dishes.

<h3>Tips for Measuring Milk</h3>
<p>When measuring milk, always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill the cup to the desired level and check at eye level to ensure you're not over or under-pouring.

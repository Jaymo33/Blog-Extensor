<p>400 grams of self-raising flour is roughly equivalent to 3.2 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you’re whipping up a cake or a batch of scones, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistent results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about making cooking easier, so let’s dive into the details.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>
<p>Baking in an air fryer requires precision, as the compact cooking space amplifies any measurement errors. Too much flour can lead to dense, dry results, while too little may cause your baked goods to collapse. Self-raising flour, which contains baking powder, is particularly sensitive to incorrect measurements. For perfect air fryer cakes or bread, always use a kitchen scale for grams or a proper measuring cup for volume. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<p>Different brands of self-raising flour can vary slightly in density, so it’s always best to weigh your ingredients if possible. However, if you don’t have scales, the 3.2 cups measurement for 400 grams is a reliable starting point.

<h2>How to Measure 400 Grams of Self-Raising Flour Without Scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 400 grams of self-raising flour using cups. The standard method is to spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and leads to inaccurate measurements. For 400 grams, you’ll need just over 3 cups, as 1 cup of self-raising flour typically weighs around 125 grams.</p>

<p>For best results, fluff the flour in its container before measuring to aerate it. This ensures a lighter, more accurate cup measurement. If you’re baking a cake in your air fryer, precise flour measurements are crucial for the perfect rise.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It’s important to note that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup is 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. For 400 grams of self-raising flour, this means approximately 3.2 UK cups or 3.3 US cups. Always check where your recipe originates to ensure accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we provide measurements for both standards to avoid confusion.</p>

<h2>Common Baking Recipes Using 400 Grams of Self-Raising Flour</h2>
<p>Many classic British bakes call for around 400 grams of self-raising flour. A Victoria sponge cake, for example, often uses this amount for a light, fluffy texture. Air fryer adaptations of these recipes benefit from the same precision. Scones, muffins, and even some bread recipes can also require 400 grams, making this conversion a handy reference.</p>

<h3>Tips for Perfect Air Fryer Baking</h3>
<p>Always preheat your air fryer for baking, just as you would a conventional oven. This ensures even cooking and proper rising. For recipes using 400 grams of self-raising flour, distribute the batter evenly in the air fryer basket or cake pan. Avoid overfilling, as this can block airflow and lead to uneven results. Experiment with lower temperatures and longer cooking times for the best texture.</p>

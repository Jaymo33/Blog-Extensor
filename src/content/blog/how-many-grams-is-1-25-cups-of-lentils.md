<p>1.25 cups of lentils weigh approximately 250 grams, making it easy to measure for air fryer recipes. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking a quick dish, knowing this conversion ensures consistency in your meals. Lentils are a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy snacks to hearty mains, so getting the measurement right is key.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of lentils ensures even cooking and perfect texture in your air fryer. Too many lentils can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven results, while too few might dry out. For dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lentil falafel</a>, precise measurements help bind ingredients properly. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Lentils expand when cooked, so measuring them correctly prevents overfilling your air fryer. A 1.25-cup portion (250g) is ideal for most recipes serving 2–4 people. If you're meal prepping, scale up using this ratio for consistent results.

<h3>Types of Lentils and Their Weights</h3>  
<p>Different lentil varieties may have slight weight variations, but 1.25 cups generally equals 250g. Red lentils are lighter, while green or brown lentils are denser. Always fluff the lentils before measuring for accuracy. Need cleaning tips?

<h2>Converting Lentils for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes use grams for precision, especially in baking or crispy snacks. If a recipe calls for 250g of lentils, you now know that’s 1.25 cups. This conversion works for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep lentil patties</a> or spiced roasted lentils.</p>  

<p>For larger batches, simply multiply the ratio—2.5 cups would be 500g, and so on. Always check your air fryer’s capacity to avoid overloading. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more handy measurement guides and recipe inspiration.</p>

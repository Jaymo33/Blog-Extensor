<p id="">Yes, you can use parchment paper in an air fryer, but it must be heat-resistant and properly sized to avoid blocking airflow. Many home cooks love using air fryer parchment paper for easy cleanup, especially when making sticky or greasy foods like salmon or chicken. Just ensure it’s rated for high temperatures (usually up to 220°C) and doesn’t touch the heating element.</p><h2 id="">Is Parchment Paper Safe for Air Fryers?</h2><p id="">When using baking paper in air fryer models, safety comes down to two factors: heat resistance and proper placement. Most parchment paper is designed for oven use, making it suitable for air fryers too. However, always check the packaging for temperature ratings—some cheaper brands may not withstand the intense heat of an air fryer.</p><p id="">Another key consideration is airflow. Greaseproof paper in air fryer baskets should be pre-cut or perforated to allow hot air circulation. You can find pre-cut rounds specifically designed for air fryers at <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/" id="">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, or trim standard sheets to fit. Never let parchment paper or aluminum foil in air fryer models cover the entire basket base, as this can cause uneven cooking.</p><h3 id="">Parchment Paper vs. Greaseproof Paper</h3><p id="">While the terms are often used interchangeably, there’s a slight difference between parchment and greaseproof paper in air fryer cooking. True parchment paper has a silicone coating that makes it non-stick and heat-resistant, whereas basic greaseproof paper lacks this coating. For best results with recipes like crispy vegetables or shrimp from <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables" id="">our vegetable collection</a>, opt for proper baking parchment.</p><h2 id="">How to Use Parchment Paper Correctly</h2><p id="">To safely use baking paper in air fryer cooking, start by selecting the right size. Most baskets need a 6-8 inch diameter circle—any larger and it might fly up during cooking. Some cooks secure the edges with a few drops of water or small metal clips (but avoid plastic). When making chicken from <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken" id="">our chicken recipes</a>, parchment prevents sticking without needing excess oil.</p><p id="">For ninja air fryer models or other brands with racks, you can place parchment paper on the rack itself rather than the basket. This works particularly well for delicate foods like fish from <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon" id="">our salmon selection</a>. Remember to never use parchment paper under the air fryer’s heating element, and always monitor your food during the first few minutes of cooking.</p><h3 id="">When to Avoid Parchment Paper</h3><p id="">There are instances when you shouldn’t put greaseproof paper in air fryer cooking. Very light foods (like herbs or small shrimp) might get blown around, and high-fat foods that splatter may require foil instead. Refer to our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart" id="">air fryer conversion chart</a> for temperature adjustments when switching between parchment and bare basket cooking.</p><h2 id="">Alternatives to Parchment Paper</h2><p id="">If you’re out of parchment paper or prefer other options, silicone mats designed for air fryers work beautifully. These reusable mats provide similar non-stick benefits without waste. For cleaning any residue, check out <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner" id="">our air fryer cleaner guide</a>. Aluminum foil can also be used cautiously—just ensure it’s secured and doesn’t block vents.</p><p id="">Some cooks skip liners altogether for certain recipes from <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes" id="">our main recipe hub</a>, especially when aiming for extra crispiness. The key is knowing your air fryer and adjusting techniques accordingly. Whether you choose parchment, foil, or nothing at all, proper preheating and occasional shaking usually prevent sticking.</p><h3 id="">Troubleshooting Common Issues</h3><p id="">If your parchment paper in air fryer use keeps curling or flying up, try weighing it down with food before closing the basket. For ninja air fryer users wondering can you use baking paper in air fryer ninja models—the answer is yes, but their unique shape may require custom-cut sheets. Always keep spare parchment on hand for quick swaps between batches.</p>

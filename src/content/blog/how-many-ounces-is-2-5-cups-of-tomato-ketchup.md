<p>2.5 cups of tomato ketchup equals approximately 20 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of air-fryer-friendly burgers or a tangy glaze for chicken, knowing how many ounces are in 2.5 cups of tomato ketchup ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Too much ketchup in a marinade, for example, might make your dish overly soggy, while too little could leave it dry. Measuring 2.5 cups of tomato ketchup to ounces (20 oz) helps maintain balance. If you’re exploring new recipes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Tomato ketchup is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from glazes to dipping sauces. Its thickness means volume-to-weight conversions aren’t always straightforward. A standard US cup holds 8 ounces, but ketchup’s density means 2.5 cups equate to 20 ounces. For UK cooks, this conversion remains the same, as fluid ounces and weight ounces align closely in this case.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Tomato Ketchup for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your ketchup. If you don’t have one, spoon the ketchup into a measuring cup without packing it down. Level it off with a knife for precision. This method ensures your 2.5 cups of tomato ketchup truly equals 20 ounces, keeping your air fryer dishes perfectly balanced.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.5 Cups of Tomato Ketchup in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for batch cooking or meal prep. For example, 20 ounces of ketchup can make a large batch of BBQ sauce for air-fried chicken wings or a glaze for meatballs. If you’re cooking for a crowd, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for crowd-pleasing ideas.</p>  

<p>Another great use is for marinating proteins like tofu or turkey before air frying. The 2.5 cups (20 oz) measurement ensures enough coverage without waste. Leftover ketchup can be stored in the fridge for future use—just make sure to keep your air fryer clean with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Serving Sizes</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for less than 2.5 cups of tomato ketchup, simply scale down the ounces proportionally. For instance, 1.25 cups would be 10 ounces. This flexibility makes it easy to adapt recipes for smaller households or larger gatherings, ensuring your air fryer meals turn out perfectly every time.</p>

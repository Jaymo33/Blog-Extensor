<h2>Why Convert 1000g of Garlic Paste to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams as the standard measurement. However, some older recipes or international guides might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 1000g of garlic paste to ounces (35.27 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount for your dish. This is particularly useful when preparing large batches or meal prepping for the week.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 1000g of Garlic Paste Accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 1000g of garlic paste. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and spoon in the paste until you reach 1000g. If you don’t have a scale, you can estimate using volume, but this method is less precise.</p>  
<p>Garlic paste is dense, so 1000g will fill roughly 2.5 standard UK measuring cups (about 400ml each). However, for air fryer recipes, we always recommend weighing ingredients for consistency.

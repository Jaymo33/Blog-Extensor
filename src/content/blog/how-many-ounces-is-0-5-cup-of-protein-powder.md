<p>0.5 cup of protein powder equals approximately 2 ounces (56 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate measurements for protein shakes, baking, or meal prep. Whether you're whipping up protein pancakes or adding powder to smoothies, knowing the weight helps achieve consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why Measure Protein Powder in Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Measuring protein powder by weight (ounces) is more precise than using cups, as density varies between brands. A scoop from one brand might weigh differently than another, leading to inconsistencies in recipes. For air fryer cooking, precision ensures your protein bars or baked goods turn out perfectly every time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the best way to measure 0.5 cup of protein powder in ounces. If you don’t have one, spoon the powder lightly into a measuring cup and level it off. Avoid packing it down, as this can add extra weight. For more tips on meal prep, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 0.5 Cup of Protein Powder</h3>  
<p>Half a cup of protein powder (2 oz) is ideal for single-serving recipes. Blend it into post-workout shakes, mix into oatmeal, or bake protein muffins in your air fryer. It’s also perfect for coating chicken or tofu before air frying for a crispy, high-protein crust. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for creative ways to use protein powder in air fryer meals.</p>  

<h2>Converting 0.5 Cup Protein Powder to Ounces</h2>  
<p>While 0.5 cup generally equals 2 ounces, always check your protein powder’s packaging for specific weight guidelines. Whey protein tends to be lighter than plant-based blends, so adjustments may be needed. For baking, weigh the powder to avoid dry or dense results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes protein-packed treats tailored for air fryers.</p>  

<p>If you’re doubling a recipe, remember 1 cup of protein powder equals roughly 4 ounces. For UK measurements, note that 1 US cup is 240ml, while 1 UK cup is 250ml—though the ounce conversion remains the same. Need to clean your air fryer after cooking?

<h3>Protein Powder Types and Their Weights</h3>  
<p>Whey isolate, casein, and pea protein vary slightly in density. For example, 0.5 cup of whey might weigh 1.8 oz, while plant-based powders could reach 2.2 oz. Always weigh if precision matters, like in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>protein desserts</a>. Store powder in a cool, dry place to maintain consistency.</p>

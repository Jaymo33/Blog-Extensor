<p>465°F converts to Gas Mark 9 in UK ovens and air fryers. This high-temperature setting is ideal for professional-style baking, pizza cooking, or achieving crispy results in your air fryer. Understanding this conversion helps when following recipes across different appliances.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 465 F to Gas Mark?</h2>
<p>Many British recipes still use Gas Mark temperatures, while modern air fryers and digital ovens display Fahrenheit. Knowing that 465 F equals Gas Mark 9 prevents undercooking or burning your dishes. This conversion is particularly useful for high-heat cooking methods like roasting meats or baking artisan bread.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend checking our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common temperature switches. Whether you're cooking frozen foods from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods category</a> or baking cakes, accurate temperature control makes all the difference.</p>

<h2>How Gas Mark Compares to Fahrenheit</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark scale runs differently to Fahrenheit, with each number representing about 25°C (45°F) increments. Gas Mark 9 at 465°F sits at the higher end of the scale, suitable for professional baking temperatures. Most domestic cooking rarely exceeds Gas Mark 9, making this a crucial conversion for serious cooks.</p>
<p>When using your air fryer at 465 F (Gas Mark 9), remember cooking times may differ from conventional ovens. The rapid air circulation means you might need to reduce cooking durations by 20% compared to gas oven recipes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes adjusted timings for perfect air fryer results.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Modern air fryers handle 465 F (Gas Mark 9) temperatures efficiently, but always check your model's maximum capability. Some compact units may not sustain this heat consistently. For best results at these high temperatures, avoid overcrowding the basket and consider using an <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> regularly to maintain performance.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 465 F (Gas Mark 9)</h2>
<p>This intense heat works perfectly for pizza, achieving that authentic crispy base in minutes. It's also ideal for flash-roasting vegetables or finishing meats with a professional-quality sear. When converting 465 Fahrenheit to Gas Mark for baking, remember that delicate items like cakes may need temperature reduction.</p>
<p>For those exploring our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, 465 F to Gas Mark conversion helps achieve restaurant-style crispy skin. The same applies to roasting potatoes or preparing frozen appetisers that benefit from quick, high-heat cooking.</p>

<h3>Safety at High Temperatures</h3>
<p>When operating your air fryer at 465 F (Gas Mark 9 equivalent), always use heat-resistant gloves or tools. The intense heat can cause burns if proper precautions aren't taken. Ensure proper ventilation in your kitchen and never leave the appliance unattended at these temperatures.</p>

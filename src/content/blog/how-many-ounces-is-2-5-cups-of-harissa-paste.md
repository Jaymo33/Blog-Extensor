<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Harissa paste, with its thick consistency, needs precise measurement to avoid overpowering or underwhelming flavours. Too much can make a dish unbearably spicy, while too little might leave it bland. That’s why converting 2.5 cups of harissa paste to ounces (20 oz) is so useful. For recipe inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section.</p>  

<p>Harissa paste is a staple in North African and Middle Eastern cuisine, often used in marinades, dips, and sauces. Its bold, smoky flavour pairs perfectly with air-fried chicken, lamb, or vegetables. If you’re new to cooking with harissa, start with smaller quantities and adjust to taste. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section features several dishes that use harissa for a flavourful kick.</p>  

<h3>How to measure harissa paste correctly</h3>  
<p>When measuring harissa paste, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Scoop the paste into the cup and level it off with a spatula. If the paste is too thick, lightly oil the measuring cup to help it slide out easily. Remember, 2.5 cups of harissa paste equals 20 ounces, so adjust your recipe accordingly.

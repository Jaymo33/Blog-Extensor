<p>0.5 cup of passata equals approximately 4.23 ounces (120 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for the best results. Whether you're making a rich tomato sauce or a hearty stew, knowing how many ounces are in 0.5 cup of passata helps you follow recipes accurately.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate passata measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of passata ensures your dishes have the perfect consistency and flavour. Too little, and your sauce might be watery; too much, and it could overpower other ingredients. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical, as the cooking process is faster and more intense. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> for dishes where passata plays a starring role.</p>  

<p>Passata is a staple in many cuisines, especially Italian-inspired dishes. Whether you're making a quick pasta sauce or a slow-cooked ragù, knowing how many ounces are in 0.5 cup of passata ensures your meal turns out just right. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>How to measure passata correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a liquid measuring cup for passata. Fill it to the 0.5 cup mark, ensuring the meniscus (the curve at the top of the liquid) aligns with the measurement line. If you're using a kitchen scale, 0.5 cup of passata weighs roughly 4.23 ounces. This method eliminates guesswork and guarantees consistency in your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for passata in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Passata is incredibly versatile and works well in many air fryer dishes. From homemade pizzas to meatball subs, it adds depth and richness without extra effort. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> that incorporate passata for a flavour boost.</p>  

<p>Another great way to use passata is in layered dishes like lasagna or moussaka. The air fryer crisps the top beautifully while keeping the inside moist and flavourful. Remember, 0.5 cup of passata equals 4.23 ounces, so adjust quantities as needed for larger batches.

<h3>Converting passata measurements for different recipes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for a different amount of passata, you can easily scale the measurement. For example, 1 cup of passata equals roughly 8.45 ounces, while 0.25 cup is about 2.12 ounces. Keeping these conversions in mind ensures you never have to pause mid-recipe to figure out measurements.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing leftover passata</h2>  
<p>If you have leftover passata, transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to five days. You can also freeze it in portion-sized containers for future use. When you’re ready to cook, simply thaw and measure out the required amount—0.5 cup of passata is always 4.23 ounces, whether fresh or frozen.</p>

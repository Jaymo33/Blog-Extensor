    "text": "Converting 10.75 kg to pounds itself doesn't directly affect cooking times, but understanding the weight in pounds helps you apply appropriate air fryer timing guidelines. Most air fryer recipes provide cooking times based on pound measurements, so knowing that 10.75 kg equals approximately 23.7 pounds ensures you follow these guidelines accurately. The actual cooking time adjustment comes from the weight itself rather than the conversion—heavier items generally require longer cooking times. Always use a meat thermometer to check internal temperatures regardless of weight conversions for perfect results every time."

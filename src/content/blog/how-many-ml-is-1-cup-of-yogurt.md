<p>1.0 cups of yogurt equals approximately 240 ml in the US measurement system and 284 ml in the UK system. If you're using an air fryer for baking or cooking, precise measurements ensure your recipes turn out just right. Whether you're whipping up a cake, marinating chicken, or preparing a creamy dessert, knowing how to convert cups to ml is essential.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Yogurt Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of yogurt can make or break a recipe. Too much can make baked goods dense, while too little might leave sauces thin. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key—especially when making dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>. Yogurt adds moisture and richness, so measuring correctly ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<p>Different countries use different cup sizes, which can be confusing. The US standard cup is 240 ml, while the UK imperial cup is 284 ml. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, it's likely using UK measurements unless stated otherwise. Always double-check to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>Converting 1.0 Cups of Yogurt to ml</h3>  
<p>For US recipes, 1.0 cups of yogurt equals 240 ml. In the UK, it's 284 ml. If you're using a digital scale, yogurt weighs roughly 245 grams per US cup and 290 grams per UK cup. This conversion is handy for recipes where precision matters, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer yogurt marinades</a> or batters.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Yogurt in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Yogurt isn't just for breakfast—it's a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It tenderises meats, adds moisture to baked goods, and creates creamy dips. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> for a juicy finish or in dough for soft, fluffy bread.</p>  

<p>For best results, use plain, unsweetened yogurt unless the recipe specifies otherwise. Greek yogurt is thicker, so adjust liquids accordingly. If you're converting a traditional oven recipe to air fryer, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for temperature and timing adjustments.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Yogurt Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, and level off the top with a knife. If substituting yogurt for other ingredients like oil or buttermilk, adjust quantities as needed. For sticky yogurts, lightly grease the measuring cup first.</p>

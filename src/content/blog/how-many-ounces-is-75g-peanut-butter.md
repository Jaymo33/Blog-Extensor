<p>75g of peanut butter equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that use imperial measurements. Whether you're whipping up peanut butter cookies or a satay sauce, getting the quantities right ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why converting 75g peanut butter to ounces matters</h2>
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use grams, while some older cookbooks or American recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Knowing that 75g of peanut butter converts to 2.65 ounces helps maintain recipe accuracy. This is particularly important in baking, where precise measurements can make or break your dish.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of getting measurements spot on. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help with other common ingredient conversions too. Whether you're making peanut butter energy balls or a peanut sauce for chicken satay, knowing your 75g to ounces conversion is invaluable.</p>

<h2>How to measure 75g of peanut butter accurately</h2>
<p>While kitchen scales are the most accurate way to measure 75g of peanut butter, not everyone has them to hand. Two level tablespoons of peanut butter will give you roughly 75g, though this can vary slightly depending on how packed the peanut butter is.</p>

<h3>Using kitchen scales for 75g peanut butter</h3>
<p>Digital kitchen scales are the gold standard for measuring 75g of peanut butter to ounces. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then scoop in peanut butter until you reach 75g. The conversion to 2.65 ounces happens automatically on most digital scales with unit conversion functions.</p>

<h3>Measuring 75g peanut butter without scales</h3>
<p>If you don't have scales, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 15g of peanut butter. This means 5 level tablespoons would give you approximately 75g. Remember that creamy peanut butter packs differently to crunchy, so this method isn't as precise as weighing.</p>

<h2>Common recipes using 75g of peanut butter</h2>
<p>Many delicious air fryer recipes call for around 75g of peanut butter. This quantity often appears in cookie recipes, satay sauces, or energy bite mixtures. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you'll find plenty of inspiration for using your measured 75g of peanut butter.</p>
<p>Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> features several peanut butter-based treats that use this measurement. From 3-ingredient peanut butter cookies to peanut butter stuffed dates, knowing your 75g to ounces conversion opens up a world of culinary possibilities.</p>

<h2>Storing and handling peanut butter</h2>
<p>Once you've measured out your 75g (2.65 ounces) of peanut butter, proper storage is key. Natural peanut butter tends to separate, so stir it well before measuring. Store opened jars upside down to help prevent oil separation and make future 75g measurements easier.</p>

<h3>Cleaning peanut butter from measuring tools</h3>
<p>Peanut butter can be sticky to clean from measuring spoons or scales. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> includes tips for tackling greasy residues. Warm soapy water works best, and a silicone spatula can help scrape out every last bit of your measured 75g portion.</p>

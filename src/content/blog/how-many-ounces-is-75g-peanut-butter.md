<h2>Why converting 75g peanut butter to ounces matters</h2>
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use grams, while some older cookbooks or American recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Knowing that 75g of peanut butter converts to 2.65 ounces helps maintain recipe accuracy. This is particularly important in baking, where precise measurements can make or break your dish.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of getting measurements spot on.

<h2>How to measure 75g of peanut butter accurately</h2>
<p>While kitchen scales are the most accurate way to measure 75g of peanut butter, not everyone has them to hand. Two level tablespoons of peanut butter will give you roughly 75g, though this can vary slightly depending on how packed the peanut butter is.</p>

<h3>Using kitchen scales for 75g peanut butter</h3>
<p>Digital kitchen scales are the gold standard for measuring 75g of peanut butter to ounces. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then scoop in peanut butter until you reach 75g. The conversion to 2.65 ounces happens automatically on most digital scales with unit conversion functions.</p>

<h3>Measuring 75g peanut butter without scales</h3>
<p>If you don't have scales, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 15g of peanut butter. This means 5 level tablespoons would give you approximately 75g. Remember that creamy peanut butter packs differently to crunchy, so this method isn't as precise as weighing.</p>

<h2>Common recipes using 75g of peanut butter</h2>

<h2>Storing and handling peanut butter</h2>
<p>Once you've measured out your 75g (2.65 ounces) of peanut butter, proper storage is key. Natural peanut butter tends to separate, so stir it well before measuring. Store opened jars upside down to help prevent oil separation and make future 75g measurements easier.</p>

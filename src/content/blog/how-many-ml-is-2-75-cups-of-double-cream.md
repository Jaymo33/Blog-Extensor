<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve even cooking and perfect textures. Using too much or too little double cream can affect the outcome of your dish, whether it’s a cake, custard, or sauce. For example, adding 650 ml instead of guessing ensures your recipe stays balanced. Many of our favourite <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for exact measurements to guarantee consistency. This is especially important for desserts like cheesecakes or mousses where cream is a key ingredient.</p>  

<p>Double cream is thicker and richer than single cream, so its volume-to-weight ratio differs slightly. While 2.75 cups of double cream is roughly 650 ml, slight variations can occur based on temperature and brand. Always measure liquids at room temperature for the most accurate results. If you’re unsure, a kitchen scale can help verify your measurements.

<h3>How to Measure Double Cream Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 2.75 cups of double cream using a standard metric jug. Since 1 cup is approximately 240 ml, 2.75 cups would be 660 ml—close enough for most recipes. However, for baking, it’s best to stick to the precise 650 ml measurement. A quick tip: fill a 250 ml glass three times, then add half of another to get close to 650 ml.

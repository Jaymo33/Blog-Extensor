<h2>Why accurate oil measurements matter in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food, and too much oil can lead to soggy results. Measuring 2.5 tbsp of sunflower oil in grams (34g) helps maintain the right balance. For recipes like roasted vegetables or homemade crisps, this precision ensures a crispy texture without excess grease.

Too little oil, and your food may dry out; too much, and it won’t crisp properly.</p>

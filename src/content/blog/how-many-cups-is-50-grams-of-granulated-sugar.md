Whether you're whipping up a cake or making cookies, knowing how many cups is 50 grams of granulated sugar ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of sugar is crucial for both taste and texture. Too much or too little can throw off your entire recipe. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies, 50 grams of granulated sugar in cups should be measured precisely to avoid overly sweet or dry results. Accurate measurements also help when scaling recipes up or down.</p>
<p>Granulated sugar is a common ingredient in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, from cakes to glazes. Using the correct amount ensures your dishes have the perfect balance of sweetness. If you're unsure, always double-check your conversions to avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 50 Grams of Granulated Sugar</h2>
<p>Measuring 50 grams of granulated sugar can be done using a kitchen scale or measuring cups. A scale is the most accurate method, but if you don’t have one, 1/4 cup is the closest equivalent. Remember, granulated sugar can settle, so fluff it up before scooping for the best results.</p>
<p>For those who love baking in their air fryer, keeping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy can save time and hassle. This way, you’ll always know how much 50g granulated sugar to cups is without second-guessing.</p>

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale</h3>
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for measuring 50 grams of granulated sugar. Simply place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, and add the sugar until you hit 50 grams. This method eliminates any guesswork and ensures precision.</p>

<h3>Using Measuring Cups</h3>
<p>If you’re using measuring cups, 50 grams of granulated sugar equals roughly 1/4 cup. Spoon the sugar into the cup and level it off with a knife for the most accurate measurement. Avoid packing the sugar down, as this can lead to using more than needed.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 50 Grams of Granulated Sugar</h2>
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> call for 50 grams of granulated sugar. This amount is perfect for small batches or individual servings. Whether you’re making a sponge cake or muffins, knowing the conversion ensures your baked goods turn out light and fluffy.</p>
<p>Other recipes, like cookies or glazes, might also use 50 grams of granulated sugar. For example, a simple glaze for air fryer doughnuts could require this amount. Always check your recipe to confirm, but 1/4 cup is a reliable starting point.</p>

<h2>Tips for Baking with Granulated Sugar</h2>
<p>When baking in your air fryer, granulated sugar plays a key role in texture and browning. For best results, ensure your sugar is fresh and free of lumps. Stale sugar can affect the taste and consistency of your dishes.</p>
<p>If you’re experimenting with recipes, keep a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean air fryer</a> to avoid any lingering flavours. This is especially important when switching between savoury and sweet dishes. A clean appliance ensures your sugar-based recipes taste their best.</p>

<h3>Storing Granulated Sugar</h3>
<p>Store granulated sugar in an airtight container to keep it fresh. Moisture can cause clumping, which makes measuring 50 grams of granulated sugar in cups more challenging. A cool, dry place is ideal for long-term storage.</p>

<h3>Substituting Granulated Sugar</h3>
<p>If you’re out of granulated sugar, you can substitute it with caster sugar in most recipes. However, the texture might vary slightly. For air fryer baking, stick to granulated sugar unless the recipe specifies otherwise.</p>

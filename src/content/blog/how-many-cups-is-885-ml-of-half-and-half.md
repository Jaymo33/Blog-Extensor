<h2>Understanding Half And Half Measurements</h2>
<p>Half and half is a dairy product made by combining equal parts whole milk and cream. It's commonly used in both cooking and baking to add richness without the heaviness of full cream. When a recipe calls for 885 ml of half and half, it's crucial to measure accurately to maintain the dish's texture and flavour.

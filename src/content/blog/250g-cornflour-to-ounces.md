<p>250g of cornflour equals approximately 8.82 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using UK recipes or working with precise measurements in baking or air frying. Whether you're preparing a cake batter or coating chicken for your air fryer, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When it comes to baking or air frying, precision is key. Cornflour, also known as cornstarch, is often used as a thickening agent or coating. Using the correct amount ensures your dishes turn out perfectly—whether you're making crispy fried chicken in your air fryer or a silky custard. A slight miscalculation can lead to soggy coatings or lumpy sauces, so getting the conversion right is crucial.</p>  

<p>For those who love experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, knowing how to convert grams to ounces is especially helpful. Many UK recipes use metric measurements, while some appliances or cookbooks might reference imperial units. Having a reliable conversion chart, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, can save time and hassle.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Cornflour Correctly</h3>  
<p>The best way to measure cornflour is by using a digital kitchen scale for accuracy. Scooping it directly from the bag with a measuring cup can lead to inconsistencies due to packing density. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the cornflour with a spoon before lightly spooning it into a measuring cup and leveling it off. This method helps avoid overpacking and ensures you’re close to the intended weight.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Cornflour in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Cornflour is a versatile ingredient in air frying. It’s often used to create a light, crispy coating on foods like chicken wings, fish, or even tofu. When mixed with seasonings, it helps achieve that golden crunch without deep frying. For example, tossing chicken pieces in a mix of cornflour and spices before air frying gives a restaurant-quality finish.</p>  

<p>Another great use is as a thickener for sauces or gravies in air fryer recipes. If you’re making a stir-fry or glaze, a small amount of cornflour can prevent sogginess and enhance texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration on how to incorporate it into your meals.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Common Weights</h3>  
<p>If you frequently work with cornflour, it’s useful to know other common conversions. For instance, 100g of cornflour is roughly 3.53 ounces, while 500g converts to about 17.64 ounces. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, can streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Cornflour</h2>  
<p>To keep cornflour fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture can cause clumping, which affects both measurement accuracy and performance in recipes. If you notice any odd smells or discoloration, it’s best to replace it. Proper storage ensures your cornflour stays ready for all your air fryer adventures.</p>

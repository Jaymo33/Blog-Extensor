<h2>Why Accurate Vinegar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vinegar can make or break a dish, especially in air fryer cooking where flavours intensify. Too little, and your marinade might lack zing; too much, and it could overpower the dish. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken recipes</a> often call for vinegar to tenderise the meat, so precision is key. Measuring 0.75 cups of vinegar in ml (177 ml) ensures consistency, whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>  

<p>Vinegar also plays a crucial role in baking, where acidity affects texture and rise. If a recipe calls for 0.75 cups of vinegar in ml, using a measuring jug with millilitre markings avoids guesswork.

<h3>How to Measure 0.75 Cups of Vinegar Without a Jug</h3>  
<p>No measuring jug? No problem. You can use a standard tablespoon (15 ml) to measure out 177 ml of vinegar—that’s about 12 tablespoons. For smaller quantities, a teaspoon (5 ml) works too, though it’ll take 36 teaspoons to hit 0.75 cups. If you’re using a kitchen scale, remember that vinegar’s density is roughly 1 gram per ml, so 177 ml weighs about 177 grams.</p>  

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>While 0.75 cups of vinegar in ml is universally 177 ml, it’s worth noting that US and UK cups differ slightly in volume. A US cup is 240 ml, whereas a UK cup is 284 ml. However, for vinegar and other liquids, the difference is negligible in most recipes. If you’re adapting a US recipe, stick to 177 ml for 0.75 cups to avoid confusion.</p>

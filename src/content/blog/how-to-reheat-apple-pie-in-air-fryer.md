<p>Reheating apple pie in an air fryer is simple: set it to 160°C (320°F) for 3-5 minutes. This method keeps the crust crispy while warming the filling evenly, making it taste freshly baked. Whether you’re using leftovers or a chilled pie, your air fryer delivers better results than a microwave.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Apple Pie?</h2>
<p>An air fryer circulates hot air around the pie, crisping the crust without drying it out. Unlike a microwave, which can make pastry soggy, the air fryer restores texture. It’s also faster than reheating in a conventional oven, saving energy and time. For more tips on perfect reheating, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>
<p>Leftover apple pie often loses its appeal when microwaved, but the air fryer brings back its original charm. The even heat distribution ensures the filling warms through without burning the edges. If you love desserts, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for more sweet ideas.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Apple Pie</h2>
<p>First, preheat your air fryer to 160°C (320°F) for 2 minutes. Place the pie slice in the basket, ensuring it’s not overcrowded. If reheating a whole pie, use a liner or foil to prevent sticking. For extra crispiness, lightly brush the crust with melted butter.</p>
<p>Cook for 3-5 minutes, checking halfway to avoid over-browning. Larger slices or whole pies may need an extra minute. Always let it cool slightly before serving. Need to clean your air fryer afterward? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it easy.</p>

<h3>Best Temperature for Reheating Apple Pie</h3>
<p>160°C (320°F) is ideal for reheating apple pie in an air fryer. This temperature warms the filling without burning the crust. If your pie has a particularly thick crust, increase to 170°C (340°F) for an extra minute.</p>

<h3>How Long to Reheat Apple Pie in an Air Fryer?</h3>
<p>Most slices need 3-5 minutes at 160°C. Whole pies or thicker slices may require 5-7 minutes. Check frequently to prevent over-crisping. For frozen apple pie, add 1-2 minutes to the time.</p>

<h2>Tips for the Best Results</h2>
<p>Use a light spritz of water on the crust if it’s drying out. For extra flavour, sprinkle cinnamon sugar before reheating. Avoid stacking slices to ensure even heating. If your pie has a lattice top, cover loosely with foil to prevent over-browning.</p>
<p>Store leftover pie properly to maintain freshness. Keep it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze individual slices. Discover more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> to expand your repertoire.</p>

<h3>Reheating Frozen Apple Pie</h3>
<p>Frozen apple pie can go straight into the air fryer at 160°C. Add 1-2 minutes to the usual time, checking regularly. No need to thaw – the air fryer will crisp it perfectly.</p>

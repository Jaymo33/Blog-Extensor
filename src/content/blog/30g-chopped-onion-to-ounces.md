<p>30g of chopped onion is approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a quick stir-fry or adding onions to a casserole, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off texture and flavour. Chopped onion, for example, releases moisture as it cooks, affecting crispiness. Using 30g (1.06 oz) ensures your dish isn’t overly soggy or dry. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> often specify weights to guarantee success. If a recipe calls for 30g of chopped onion and you eyeball it, you might end up with unevenly cooked onions or an imbalanced flavour profile. Precision is key, especially for beginners.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 30g of Chopped Onion</h3>  
<p>Use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add chopped onion until it hits 30g (1.06 oz). No scale? A tightly packed UK tablespoon holds roughly 10g, so three tablespoons will get you close. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based dishes</a>, consistency matters.</p>  

<h2>Converting 30g Chopped Onion to Ounces for UK Cooks</h2>  
<p>In the UK, recipes often use grams, but some older cookbooks or international recipes might list ounces. Knowing that 30g equals 1.06 oz helps avoid confusion. This is particularly useful for air fryer users adapting recipes from sources like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>For context, 30g of chopped onion is roughly a small onion’s worth. If you’re prepping ingredients in advance, this measurement helps with portion control. Store unused chopped onion in an airtight container—it’ll keep for up to three days in the fridge.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 30g Chopped Onion</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer favourites, like stuffed peppers or fajitas, call for 30g of chopped onion. It’s a versatile amount that adds flavour without overpowering. For a deeper dive into onion-heavy dishes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef recipes</a>, where onions often play a starring role.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Chopping Onions for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Uniform pieces ensure even cooking. Aim for 0.5cm dice when chopping onions for air fryer dishes—this size caramelises nicely without burning. After handling onions, clean your air fryer basket with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our recommended cleaner</a> to avoid lingering odours.</p>  

<p>If you’re short on time, pre-chopped frozen onions are a handy alternative. Just note that 30g of frozen chopped onion may have slightly more moisture, so adjust cooking times accordingly. Always pat them dry if excess water is present.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 100g of Protein Powder Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use tablespoons to measure 100g of protein powder. On average, one tablespoon holds about 10g, so 100g would be roughly 10 tablespoons. However, this can vary by brand, so check the packaging for precise measurements.</p>

<h2>Protein Powder Types and Their Weight Differences</h2>

<p>174°C in a fan oven converts to approximately 190-195°C in a conventional oven. This 10-15°C difference accounts for the fan oven's efficient heat circulation. Understanding this conversion is crucial when adapting recipes between appliances, especially when using an air fryer which often mimics fan oven settings.</p>

<h2>Why Fan Oven Temperatures Differ</h2>
<p>Fan ovens cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens because they circulate hot air. The constant airflow means you can typically reduce temperatures by 10-15°C compared to conventional ovens. At <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend checking our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">air fryer conversion chart</a> for precise adjustments when switching between appliances.</p>
<p>When converting 174 fan oven to conventional oven settings, remember that baking times may need slight adjustment too. The higher temperature in conventional ovens compensates for less efficient heat distribution. This principle applies whether you're baking <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes">cakes</a> or roasting vegetables.</p>

<h2>Practical Conversion Examples</h2>
<p>Let's explore how 174 fan oven translates to different cooking scenarios. For delicate items like soufflés or custards, stick to the lower end (190°C) to prevent over-browning. Hearty dishes like casseroles or roasted meats can handle the full 195°C conversion.</p>
<h3>Air Fryer Equivalent Temperatures</h3>
<p>Most air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens, so 174°C in an air fryer would typically match the fan oven setting. However, some compact models may require 5°C less. Always check your specific model's manual and browse our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">air fryer recipes</a> for tailored guidance.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Cooking Times</h2>
<p>When converting 174 fan oven to conventional oven, cooking times may increase by 5-10 minutes. The exact adjustment depends on your oven's efficiency and the dish's density. A good rule is to check doneness 5 minutes before the recipe's suggested time when using conventional settings.</p>
<p>For air fryer conversions from 174 fan oven recipes, you'll often reduce cooking times by 20%. The rapid air circulation cooks food faster, so monitoring is key. Our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner">cleaning guide</a> helps maintain optimal air fryer performance for accurate temperature control.</p>

<h2>Common Conversion Mistakes</h2>
<p>Many home cooks forget to adjust both temperature and time when converting 174 fan oven to conventional oven settings. Another frequent error is assuming all ovens calibrate perfectly - using an oven thermometer ensures accuracy. When adapting <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken">chicken recipes</a>, proper conversion prevents undercooking or drying out.</p>
<h3>Special Considerations for Baking</h3>
<p>Baked goods are particularly sensitive to temperature changes. When converting 174 fan oven to conventional oven for cakes or cookies, consider reducing the temperature slightly (to 185°C) and extending the time if your oven runs hot. This prevents over-browning while ensuring thorough cooking.</p>
